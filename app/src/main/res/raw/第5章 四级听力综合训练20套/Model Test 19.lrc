[00:15.34]College English Test - Band 4
[00:19.43]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:23.91]Section A
[00:25.65]Directions: In this section,
[00:29.44]you will hear three news reports.
[00:32.34]At the end of each news report,
[00:34.73]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:38.36]Both the news report and the questions
[00:41.41]will be spoken only once.
[00:44.40]After you hear a question,
[00:46.04]you must choose the best answer
[00:48.49]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:54.96]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:58.95]with a single line through the centre.
[01:02.41]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[01:10.33]Rallies were recently held in New Hampshire, Iowa,
[01:13.91]South Carolina and Illinois.
[01:16.71]Of all the questions voters asked of candidates,
[01:20.08]27 percent were about the economy.
[01:23.54]Health care came in second-most asked,
[01:26.75]at 15 percent of the questions.
[01:29.27]Concerns about immigration came in at 12 percent.
[01:34.62]Just 10 percent of the questions asked of the candidates
[01:38.35]were about national security or terrorism.
[01:41.98]A survey in December found 16 percent of Americans listed terrorism
[01:48.20]as their top concern.
[01:50.38]Candidates were often asked about the Second Amendment.
[01:53.57]That amendment states that "A well-regulated military,
[01:58.60]being necessary to the security of a free State,
[02:01.83]shall not be destroyed.”
[02:04.32]Many Americans interpret, or define it, different ways.
[02:08.60]That has led to conflict about gun use in America.
[02:12.68]Republican candidates were more likely to be asked
[02:16.32]about welfare abuse and immigration.
[02:19.65]Questions about climate were asked 5 percent of the time.
[02:23.70]Race issues were asked 2.5 percent of all questions.
[02:30.00]1. What do we learn about the questions voters asked of candidates?
[02:50.94]2. What were more likely to be asked to Republican candidates?
[03:11.15]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[03:18.64]Police in Indonesia have identified four out of five of the Jakarta attackers.
[03:23.46]Two were previously convicted terrorists.
[03:26.21]Police named one---Afif Sunakim,
[03:28.68]seen carrying a gun and a bag during the attacks.
[03:32.04]He was given a seven-year jail term for attending a terrorist camp.
[03:36.26]All five died in Thursday's attacks,
[03:38.85]which left two civilians dead and were claimed by Islamic State (IS).
[03:44.02]Three arrests were made on Friday but it is unclear if they are connected.
[03:48.55]Security forces battled terrorists for hours
[03:51.54]in the busy commercial district where the terrorists struck.
[03:55.38]A Canadian and an Indonesian national died,
[03:58.36]and at least 20 people were injured.
[04:00.60]The attack ended when two attackers died in a suicide bombing,
[04:04.73]police say,
[04:05.73]with the other three killed in gun battles.
[04:08.58]Following recent IS threats,
[04:10.06]the country,
[04:11.15]which had been attacked by Islamist terrorists several times in the past,
[04:15.01]had been on high alert.
[04:18.83]3. What is the news report mainly about?
[04:38.48]4. What do we learn about the attack from the news report?
[04:58.38]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[05:06.14]On October 17,
[05:08.58]hurricane Gonzalo hit the island of Bermuda,
[05:11.66]knocking down trees and power lines,
[05:14.45]and making roads and streets impassable.
[05:17.19]The damage was substantial.
[05:19.53]But thanks to early warnings from forecasters,
[05:22.76]residents were able to prepare
[05:24.85]and no deaths or serious injuries were reported.
[05:28.78]Scientists say weather systems are hard to predict
[05:32.56]because so many variables have to be taken into account.
[05:36.69]But increasingly complex calculation methods
[05:40.43]and accessibility to supercomputers
[05:43.51]are making weather prediction much easier.
[05:46.70]Air pollution is another modern disaster
[05:50.43]that affects large cities and industrial areas.
[05:54.01]So its adverse effect on health
[05:56.45]also makes its timely measurement important.
[05:59.88]Even in cities that do not have pollution problems,
[06:03.52]it is important to measure other atmospheric conditions.
[06:07.60]University of Geneva research team leader said
[06:11.89]their new instrument uses an optical detector with radiation technology.
[06:17.96]The device is highly specific
[06:20.45]and allows identification of different kind of particles
[06:23.78]in the atmosphere.
[06:25.28]We are able to detect
[06:27.14]and measure different species of flower powder in the real time.
[06:32.07]The Brussels exhibition,
[06:33.91]now in its fifth year,
[06:35.60]drew more than 2,500 people from around the world
[06:39.53]to see the latest weather and climate change forecasting technology.
[06:45.38]5. When did the hurricane hit the island of Bermuda?
[07:05.13]6. What is the modern disaster
[07:09.26]that affected the large cities and industrial areas?
[07:27.38]7. What can the new instrument of the research team do?
[07:46.59]Section B
[07:48.88]Directions: In this section,
[07:52.63]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:56.11]At the end of each conversation,
[07:58.60]you will hear four questions.
[08:00.99]Both the conversation and the questions
[08:04.48]will be spoken only once.
[08:06.92]After you hear a question,
[08:09.21]you must choose the best answer
[08:11.64]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).

[11:42.61]W: Oh, Paul, you look tired.
[11:45.30]Two months away in the capital?
[11:47.49]Paul, I think you've been working too hard.
[11:50.67]M: I'm fine. The city is very hot at this time of the year.
[11:55.25]It's good to get back to some fresh air.
[11:58.06]You know, Lisa,
[11:59.31]what they say about pregnant women really is true.
[12:02.99]W: What's that, Paul?
[12:04.53]M: They say they look beautiful.

[12:31.55]you mentioned on the phone.
[12:33.24]You sounded very excited about it!
[12:36.13]M: You know, I've learned a lot from the project.
[12:39.36]I'm surprised that was still in business.
[12:41.85]W: That's because we have a wonderful sales manager --- you!
[12:46.83]M: Thanks. But that's not the problem at all.
[12:50.31]Lisa, our little company,
[12:52.35]and it is little compared to the giants in the city.
[12:55.68]Our little company's in danger.
[12:58.42]We are out of date. We need to expand.
[13:02.00]If we don't, we'll be swallowed up by one of the giants.
[13:07.46]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.

[14:37.49]Section C
[14:39.68]Directions: In this section,
[14:43.32]you will hear three passages.
[14:45.75]At the end of each passage,
[14:48.19]you will hear some questions.
[14:50.28]Both the passage and the questions
[14:53.06]will be spoken only once.
[14:56.10]After you hear a question,
[14:58.38]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[15:02.57]marked A), B), C) and D).
[15:06.75]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[15:11.17]with a single line through the centre.
[15:14.64]Passage One
[15:17.41]Farmington, Utah, is a more pleasant community
[15:20.99]since a local girls' 4-H club improved Main Street.
[15:25.84]Six 4-H girls worked to clean a 72-foot curbside
[15:30.47]that was covered with weeds, rocks and trash.
[15:34.25]Each member volunteered to clean up
[15:36.84]and to dig in plot, five flats of flowers.
[15:40.38]They also took turns in watering, weeding and maintaining the plot.
[15:45.05]Participation in this project helped the girls develop a new attitude
[15:49.58]towards the appearance of their own homes;
[15:53.07]they've learned how to work with tools,
[15:55.21]and improve their work habits.
[15:57.74]One mother said that before her daughter was involved in this project,
[16:01.97]she would not even pull a weed.
[16:04.26]The experience on Main Street stimulated self-improvement,
[16:08.49]and encouraged members to take pride in their home grounds
[16:12.11]and in the total community.
[16:14.75]City officials cooperated with the 4-H members in planting trees,
[16:19.82]building cooking facilities, picnic tables, swings and public restrooms.
[16:25.50]The 4-H girls planted trees and took care of them
[16:29.03]during the early stages of growth.
[16:31.42]The total park project needed more plantings in the following years.
[16:35.65]Members of the 4-H club agreed to follow the project
[16:39.23]through to completion,
[16:40.94]because they receive satisfaction from the results of constructive work.
[16:45.61]The project is a growing one and has spread from the park
[16:49.34]to the school and the shopping center.
[16:52.23]Trees and flowers have all been planted in the shopping center,
[16:56.76]making the atmosphere pleasant.
[16:59.39]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:04.63]16. What do we learn about Main Street in Farmington?
[17:24.10]17. What did the 4-H club members do about the curbside?
[17:44.20]18. What have the 4-H girls learned from the project?
[18:02.93]19. Why did the 4-H girls agree to follow the park project
[18:09.49]through to completion?
[18:24.27]Passage Two
[18:27.38]According to a survey on reading conducted in 2001
[18:31.56]by the U.S. National Education Association,
[18:35.00]young Americans say reading is important,
[18:38.24]more important than computers and science.
[18:41.93]Over 50% of the 12- to 18-year olds interviewed
[18:46.44]said they enjoy reading a lot.
[18:49.43]79% find it stimulating and interesting.
[18:53.51]And 87% think it is relaxing.
[18:57.29]About 68% of those surveyed disagree with the opinion
[19:02.01]that reading is boring or old-fashioned.
[19:05.32]Over half the teenagers interviewed
[19:07.57]said they read more than ten books a year.
[19:10.66]The results also show that middle school students read more books
[19:15.34]than high schoolers.
[19:17.43]Over 66% of teens like to read fiction, such as novels and stories.
[19:23.71]Only 26% were interested in non-fiction, such as history books.
[19:29.79]64% of students listed reading "stories about people my own age"
[19:35.76]as their favorite topic.
[19:38.00]Mysteries and detective stories came second on the list at 53%.
[19:44.27]Just under 50% said they were interested
[19:47.91]in reading about their own culture and tradition.
[19:51.69]Of the teenagers who participated in the survey,
[19:55.12]49% said that libraries are where they get most of their books.
[20:00.35]However, many complain
[20:02.74]that their school libraries do not have enough up-to-date
[20:06.32]interesting books and magazines.
[20:09.36]Even though many teenagers in the US enjoy reading,
[20:13.29]they still have other interests.
[20:16.76]When asked which activity would be the most difficult
[20:20.08]to give up for a week,
[20:21.97]48% said listening to music.
[20:25.11]TV would be difficult to give up for 25% of those surveyed.
[20:30.55]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:36.67]20. What does the survey on teenager reading show?
[20:57.71]21. What books are most popular among teenagers according to the survey?
[21:19.54]22. What activity do teenagers find the most difficult to give up for a week?
[21:42.53]Passage Three
[21:44.41]Thank you for coming, everyone.
[21:46.98]Today's presentation will show
[21:49.29]how we see the development of the motor car,
[21:52.38]in the short to medium term,
[21:54.68]and that is why we have invited all of you here today.
[21:58.11]Let's start with power.
[21:59.75]It's clear that petrol-driven engines have no future.
[22:03.69]Already there are many alternative fuel vehicles on the market,
[22:07.67]powered by anything from solar power to natural gas.
[22:11.55]Some independent thinkers have even produced cars
[22:15.15]that run on vegetable oil!
[22:17.24]But, as we all know,
[22:18.78]of all these alternative fuel vehicles,
[22:21.41]the most practical are electric vehicles.
[22:23.90]Sure, in the past electric vehicles have their problems,
[22:27.34]namely, a limited driving range and very few recharging points,
[22:31.97]which limited their use.
[22:33.86]Now, however, recent developments in electric vehicle technology
[22:38.44]mean they can match conventional petrol engines
[22:41.69]in terms of performance and safety.
[22:44.53]Let's not forget that electric vehicles are cleaner.
[22:48.06]Plus, importantly,
[22:49.75]the power source is rechargeable
[22:51.99]so this does not involve using any valuable resources.
[22:55.83]Moving on to communications,
[22:57.82]very soon cars will be linked to GPS satellites,
[23:01.85]so they'll do all the driving for you.
[23:04.68]What controls remain for the users will be audio-based.
[23:08.66]So, for example,
[23:10.31]you'll just have to say "a bit warmer"
[23:13.14]and the air conditioning will adjust automatically.
[23:16.53]You'll also be able to receive e-mail,
[23:18.77]music and movies all via an internet link.
[23:22.95]So, just tap in the destination you want,
[23:25.69]sit back, sleep, watch a movie, whatever!
[23:29.41]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[23:35.59]23. What is the presentation mainly about?
[23:56.41]24. What used to restrict the use of electric vehicles?
[24:17.55]25. What does the speaker say about electric vehicles of today?
[24:38.58]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[24:41.97]
