[00:15.12]College English Test - Band 4
[00:19.61]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:23.54]Section A
[00:25.78]Directions: In this section,
[00:29.51]you will hear three news reports.
[00:32.35]At the end of each news report,
[00:34.84]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:38.39]Both the news report and the questions
[00:41.47]will be spoken only once.
[00:44.16]After you hear a question,
[00:46.10]you must choose the best answer
[00:48.59]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:54.71]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:59.04]with a single line through the centre.
[01:02.23]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[01:09.24]If you feel like you had one too many drinks
[01:12.09]over the winter holiday season
[01:14.18]---you probably did.
[01:15.77]At least,
[01:17.02]if tough new guidelines on drinking just announced
[01:19.91]by the UK’s chief medical officers are anything to go by.
[01:24.89]The new guidelines suggest
[01:27.33]that both men and women should regularly drink
[01:31.06]no more than 14 units of alcohol per week.
[01:34.84]That’s the equivalent of six small glasses of wine.
[01:38.93]Pregnant women should not drink at all.
[01:41.72]Guidelines in the U.S. recommend
[01:44.61]that women should not exceed one standard drink per day
[01:48.24]and men should no more than two.
[01:51.12]That equates to 12 units a week for women and just over 24 for men.
[01:57.36]Most worryingly, perhaps,
[01:59.95]the new UK advice suggests that there is no safe level of drinking
[02:04.88]---and any amount of alcohol can increase the risk of cancer,
[02:08.80]according to new research.
[02:12.34]1. What is the amount of alcohol suggested in the new guideline?
[02:32.57]2. What worries people most according to the news report?
[02:52.48]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[03:00.36]In Disney’s cartoon Wall-E,
[03:02.70]the robot is left behind on a deserted Earth
[03:05.98]to clean up the waste mankind left behind.
[03:09.37]If the latest statistics are anything to go by,
[03:12.45]we’re in danger of turning that fictional future into a reality.
[03:17.18]A decade ago,
[03:18.48]city residents generated 680 million tonnes of solid waste a year.
[03:23.90]Now this is 1.3 billion tonnes,
[03:27.82]and forecast to rise to 2.2 billion tonnes by 2025.
[03:33.37]But could technology,
[03:35.21]which helped create much of this waste,
[03:37.15]also help deal with it?
[03:38.89]Much of the world’s waste goes to landfill sites,
[03:42.43]which only add to the pollution problem
[03:44.52]because they produce methane
[03:46.41]---a greenhouse gas and significant contributor to climate change.
[03:50.64]But technology is helping to extract the gas and turn it into electricity.
[03:56.42]For example,
[03:57.32]US-based Ener-Core has built installations
[04:00.75]at landfill sites in California and the Netherlands
[04:04.19]that can produce between 250 kilowatts and 1 megawatt of electricity.
[04:10.62]3. What is the problem mentioned in the news report?
[04:30.29]4. What problem does the waste going to landfill sites cause?
[04:50.85]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:58.08]Five million jobs in the world’s leading economies could disappear
[05:03.35]over the next five years because of advances in technology.
[05:08.59]Developments in artificial intelligence, robotics,
[05:11.93]and biotechnology,
[05:13.62]would disturb the business world in a similar way
[05:16.86]to previous industrial revolutions,
[05:19.60]the World Economic Forum said in a report.
[05:22.83]Administrative and white collar office jobs are most at risk
[05:27.82]from a “fourth industrial revolution,”
[05:30.48]the forum said on the eve of its annual meeting.
[05:34.04]It found that as many as 7.1 million jobs
[05:38.17]in the world’s richest countries could be lost.
[05:41.50]Those losses would be partially compensated
[05:44.73]by the creation of 2.1 million new opportunities
[05:48.76]in sectors such as tech,
[05:51.23]professional services and media.
[05:54.53]Countries will have to invest in transforming their workforce
[05:58.56]if they want to keep up with the changes
[06:01.20]and avoid a worse case of “talent shortages,
[06:04.58]mass unemployment and growing inequality,”
[06:07.73]said Klaus Schwab,
[06:09.32]the founder and chairman of the World Economic Forum.
[06:13.10]Investing in education and adult learning programs
[06:16.78]is a good place to start.
[06:18.78]Around 65% of children starting primary school today
[06:23.76]will end up working in jobs that don't yet exist,
[06:27.59]and their future training is crucial,
[06:30.38]according to the report.
[06:32.02]Insisting on more diverse workforces in terms of gender,
[06:36.45]ethnicity and age,
[06:38.45]will also be vital for companies
[06:40.84]that want to succeed in the rapidly changing world.
[06:46.42]5. What will happen in the next five years
[06:50.25]because of technology development?
[07:07.18]6. What does Schwab suggest countries do?
[07:26.17]7. What should companies do to succeed in the changing world?
[07:46.27]Section B
[07:48.61]Directions: In this section,
[07:52.24]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:55.67]At the end of each conversation,
[07:58.31]you will hear four questions.
[08:00.60]Both the conversation and the questions
[08:03.88]will be spoken only once.
[08:06.57]After you hear a question,
[08:08.81]you must choose the best answer
[08:11.15]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[08:17.12]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[08:21.55]with a single line through the centre.
[08:25.51]Conversation One
[08:28.63]M: What do you think of my new sweater, Tracy?
[08:33.08]W: Well.
[08:34.07]It's very nice as far as I can see, but put it on first,
[08:39.15]then I'll tell you if it suits you.
[08:42.04]M: I tried on about twenty.
[08:44.92]This one isn't really what I wanted.
[08:48.11]W: Why did you buy it then?
[08:50.64]M: The salesman sold it to me
[08:52.93]before I realized what had happened.
[08:55.87]He just never stopped talking and he told me some stories
[09:00.35]about the latest fashion and special reductions.
[09:04.53]Before I could say anything he'd wrapped it up
[09:08.46]and taken my money.
[09:10.35]W: Well, it doesn't look too bad.
[09:13.33]I think it looks good on you.
[09:16.09]M: But I went out to get a blue sweater with a V-neck,
[09:20.42]short sleeves and pattern,
[09:23.10]and I came home with a brown one with a high neck,
[09:27.31]long sleeves and no pattern.
[09:30.45]W: You must be easily taken in.
[09:33.54]You've got to learn to stand up to these high-pressure salesmen.
[09:37.96]They'll sell you all sorts of things you don't want
[09:41.40]if you don't watch out.
[09:43.79]M: Next time I'll send my wife.
[09:46.78]She'll probably sell something to the salesman.
[09:50.26]W: That's a good idea.
[09:52.40]Actually women are good at shopping.
[09:56.19]Whenever my husband and I buy something important,
[09:59.77]I have the final say.
[10:01.91]M: I must admit that women have better taste in shopping.
[10:06.69]I should simply leave the whole business to them.
[10:10.37]W: Yes, I agree.
[10:15.07]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:22.69]8. What is the main idea of this conversation?
[10:42.42]9. Why does the man buy a sweater which he doesn’t like?
[11:03.19]10. Which character is not true about the sweater that the man buys?
[11:24.29]11. What is the woman’s suggestion?
[11:43.43]Conversation Two
[11:47.20]M: Hi, honey! What's going on?
[11:50.48]W: I have great news to tell you.
[11:53.72]I just found out that I was accepted as an R.A. next year!
[11:59.09]M: That's really great news!
[12:02.38]I'm sorry that you had to postpone your studying abroad
[12:06.27]because I lost my job.
[12:08.21]I just interviewed at a home grocery delivery business,
[12:12.94]so we'll see if I get hired.
[12:15.72]W: Don't worry.
[12:17.07]Everything will be OK!
[12:19.61]M: I think so.
[12:21.70]Don't forget I'm an optimist.
[12:25.08]W: Eh, dad, I want to talk with you
[12:28.42]about declaring a major in anthropology.
[12:31.80]Business isn't the best choice for me.
[12:35.14]M: Well, I don't know why you can't declare your own major.
[12:40.22]If this is what you really want to do,
[12:43.51]then your mother and I will support your decision.
[12:47.44]W: Thanks, dad! I just want you to know that I will make you proud!
[12:52.96]M: Your mother and I are already proud of you.
[12:56.85]W: Thanks, dad.
[12:58.69]I am really interested in anthropology
[13:01.77]and I promise that I will become a success with my degree.
[13:05.95]M: We believe in you!
[13:08.90]W: Well, I'd better hang up.
[13:12.08]I have a lot of reading to catch up on before finals.
[13:17.01]Talk to you soon!
[13:20.53]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[13:28.48]12. Which is true about the man according to the conversation?
[13:48.96]13. Why does the man feel sorry?
[14:08.30]14. Where does this conversation most probably take place?
[14:28.36]15. What will the woman probably do after the talk?
[14:48.88]Section C
[14:51.02]Directions: In this section,
[14:54.60]you will hear three short passages.
[14:57.09]At the end of each passage,
[14:59.53]you will hear some questions.
[15:01.52]Both the passage and the questions
[15:04.51]will be spoken only once.
[15:07.39]After you hear a question,
[15:09.73]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[15:13.77]marked A), B), C) and D).
[15:18.45]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[15:22.94]with a single line through the centre.
[15:26.47]Passage One
[15:29.34]Paul, a salesman from London,
[15:32.73]was driving past a sports car parked outside a supermarket
[15:37.21]when he saw it start to roll slowly down the hill.
[15:41.74]Inside the car were two young girls on the passenger seat but no driver.
[15:49.21]Paul stopped quickly,
[15:51.70]jumped in front of the sports car and tried to stop it
[15:56.33]-pushing against the front of the car.
[15:59.76]Another man, who was standing nearby,
[16:03.00]got into the car and put on the hand brake,
[16:07.28]saving the girls from injury.
[16:10.16]It was at this point that Paul noticed his own car
[16:14.89]rolling slowly down the hill
[16:17.58]and going too fast for him to stop it.
[16:21.36]It crashed into a bus at the bottom of the hill
[16:25.24]and was so badly damaged
[16:27.93]that it had to be pulled away to a garage.
[16:31.41]As if this was not bad enough,
[16:34.75]Paul now found he had no one to blame.
[16:38.33]He was so busy chasing his car
[16:41.41]that he did not get the name of the driver of the sports car
[16:45.57]who just came out of the supermarket
[16:48.45]and drove away without realizing what had happened.
[16:54.97]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:01.93]16. Which car was badly damaged?
[17:22.27]17. Where was the driver of the sports car
[17:28.10]when the accident happened?
[17:44.48]18. Who did Paul think was to blame for the accident?
[18:06.04]19. Who was injured in the accident?
[18:25.48]Passage Two
[18:28.75]My friend Vernon Davies kept birds.
[18:32.89]One day he phoned and told me he was going away for a week.
[18:38.21]He asked me to feed the birds for him
[18:41.54]and said that he would leave the key
[18:43.54]to his front door in my mailbox.
[18:46.97]Unfortunately, I forgot all about the birds
[18:51.05]until the night before Vernon was going to return.
[18:55.78]What was worse, it was already dark
[18:59.30]when I arrived at his house.
[19:02.44]I soon found that the key Vernon gave me
[19:05.82]could not unlock either the front door or the back door.
[19:11.64]I was getting desperate.
[19:13.73]I kept thinking of what Vernon would say
[19:17.11]when he came back.
[19:19.05]I was just going to give up
[19:21.29]when I noticed that one bedroom window was slightly open.
[19:26.76]I found a barrel and pushed it under the window.
[19:31.04]As the barrel was very heavy,
[19:34.23]I made a lot of noise.
[19:36.42]But in the end, I managed to climb up and open the window.
[19:42.44]I actually had one leg inside the bedroom
[19:45.92]when I suddenly realized that someone was shining a torch up at me.
[19:51.59]I looked down and saw a policeman and an old lady,
[19:56.17]one of Vernon's neighbors.
[19:59.08]"What are you doing up there?"
[20:01.61]said the policeman.
[20:03.11]Feeling like a complete fool, I replied,
[20:07.72]"I was just going to feed Mr. Davies' birds."
[20:13.04]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:20.95]20. Why couldn't the man open the door?
[20:40.65]21. Why did the man feel desperate?
[21:01.00]22. Why did the man feel like a fool?
[21:21.41]Passage Three
[21:24.45]When Iraqi troops blew up hundreds of Kuwaiti oil wells
[21:29.10]at the end of the Gulf War,
[21:31.34]scientists feared an environmental disaster.
[21:35.33]Would black powder and the smoke from the fires
[21:39.16]circle the globe and block out the sun? Many said "No way.
[21:45.13]Rain would wash the black powder from the atmosphere."
[21:49.37]But in America, air-sampling balloons
[21:53.45]have detected high concentrations of particles
[21:57.10]similar to those collected in Kuwait.
[22:00.48]Now that the fires are out,
[22:03.52]scientists are turning attention to yet another threat
[22:07.90]-the oil did not catch fire.
[22:10.78]It has formed huge lakes in the Kuwaiti deserts.
[22:15.75]They trap insects and birds
[22:18.13]and poison a variety of other desert animals and plants.
[22:23.06]The only good news is that the oil lakes
[22:26.54]have not affected the underground water resources.
[22:30.63]So far, the oil has not been absorbed
[22:34.59]because of the hard sand just below the surface.
[22:39.36]Nothing, however, stops the oil from evaporating.
[22:44.09]The resulting poisonous gases are choking nearby residents.
[22:49.61]Officials are trying to organize a quick clean-up,
[22:53.59]but they are not sure how to do it.
[22:56.78]One possibility is to burn the oil.
[23:00.46]Get those black powder detectors ready.
[23:05.29]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[23:12.79]23. What were the scientists worried about soon after the Gulf War?
[23:36.00]24. What was the good news for scientists?
[23:56.30]25. What are the officials trying to do at the moment?
[24:18.20]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[24:21.74]
