[00:18.69]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:22.05]Section A
[00:24.66]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.51]you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.81]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.51]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:34.16]Both the news report and the questions
[00:36.30]will be spoken only once.
[00:38.77]After you hear a question,
[00:40.61]you must choose the best answer
[00:42.30]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:46.90]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:50.39]with a single line through the centre.
[00:53.68]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:58.77]The family of Sarai Sierra, 
[01:00.84]an American woman who went missing in Istanbul 
[01:03.35]nearly two weeks ago, 
[01:04.78]was heartbroken after learning 
[01:06.48]that Turkish police found her body Saturday. 
[01:09.98]Turkish police found the woman’s body 
[01:11.83]near ancient stone walls in Istanbul’s Sarayburnu district. 
[01:16.17]Police suspected she had been killed at another location. 
[01:19.53]Police told CNN 
[01:20.74]that the body of the 33-year-old mother of two 
[01:23.59]showed signs of stab wounds. 
[01:25.78]However, the police chief of Istanbul, Huseyin Capkin, 
[01:30.06]said Sierra died from a blow to her head. 
[01:32.97]Nine suspects had been arrested 
[01:35.38]in connection with the woman’s disappearance and death. 
[01:38.29]Sierra’s family and friends first sounded the alarm last week 
[01:42.68]after she did not arrive on a return flight from Istanbul on January 22.
[01:49.67]1. What were Turkish police unsure about?
[02:09.88]2. How many people had been arrested by Turkish police?
[02:30.38]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:35.06]French forces say they have entered Kidal in the north of Mali, 
[02:39.50]the last major town they have yet to secure in their drive 
[02:43.69]against Islamist militants. 
[02:46.39]French forces now control Kidal airport 
[02:49.79]after a number of aircraft, 
[02:51.92]including helicopters, 
[02:53.43]landed there last night. 
[02:55.78]Islamist militants were reported to have already left the town 
[03:00.11]and it was unclear who was in charge. 
[03:03.51]France---the former colonial power in Mali---
[03:07.19]launched a military operation this month 
[03:10.55]after Islamist militants appeared to be threatening the south. 
[03:14.64]French army spokesman confirms 
[03:17.34]that “French troops were sent overnight in Kidal”. 
[03:21.65]One regional security source told the Press 
[03:24.99]that French aircraft had landed at Kidal 
[03:28.28]and that protection helicopters are in the sky. 
[03:31.98]Kidal, 930 miles north-east of the capital Bamako, 
[03:37.08]was until recently under the control of the Islamist militants.
[03:44.04]3. What is the situation now in Kidal?
[04:03.32]4. Why did the French launch the military operation?
[04:22.97]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:28.26]Adults who lack basic science and maths skills 
[04:31.21]risk being “deceived” and making bad decisions, 
[04:34.32]according to a leading scientist. 
[04:36.63]Teaching maths and science to all up to 18 
[04:40.22]would “produce a wiser population”, 
[04:42.66]says new British Science Association president Dame Athene Donald.
[04:47.22]Prof Donald will use her address to next week’s British Science Festival 
[04:51.71]to urge major changes to UK education. 
[04:54.90]“Citizens need to be permitted to make good decisions 
[04:58.11]in their private lives.” 
[04:59.59]she will tell the festival, 
[05:00.74]at Bradford University. 
[05:02.54]In order for this to happen, 
[05:03.84]she will say, 
[05:04.69]more young people need to be interested in 
[05:07.14]and comfortable with science.
[05:09.68]She believes the problem starts young, 
[05:11.48]with too few teachers able to teach primary school science 
[05:15.55]or trained as subject specialists at secondary level. 
[05:19.08]Forcing pupils to make subject choices from the age of 14, 
[05:22.73]effectively divides the nation “into sheep and goats, 
[05:26.24]science people and arts people”, 
[05:28.33]she will argue. 
[05:29.32]“We may be laughed at 
[05:30.64]if our knowledge of Shakespeare or Austen isn’t perfect, 
[05:33.82]but it is still OK to say ‘I could never do maths at school.’”
[05:40.32]5. What is the news report mainly about?
[06:00.17]6. What will Prof Donald say in the science festival?
[06:20.65]7. What if you don’t know Shakespeare or Austen well?
[06:40.83]Section B
[06:42.44]Directions: In this section,
[06:44.97]you will hear two long conversations.
[06:47.36]At the end of each conversation,
[06:49.25]you will hear four questions.
[06:51.46]Both the conversation and the questions
[06:53.80]will be spoken only once.
[06:55.69]After you hear a question,
[06:57.70]you must choose the best answer
[06:59.65]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:04.84]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:08.54]with a single line through the centre.
[07:11.92]Conversation One
[07:15.01]W: So, have you found a job yet?
[07:17.62]M: No, but, I have a few leads, so things are looking up.
[07:22.19]W: What kind of job are you looking for?
[07:25.35]M: Actually, I want to work for a Web hosting company.
[07:29.36]W: What would you do there exactly?
[07:32.20]M: Well, I'd like to work in technical support, you know,
[07:37.08]helping customers resolve computer-related problems with their sites.
[07:41.63]And you know I'm a good communicator.
[07:45.16]W: So, how's the pay for that sort of job?
[07:48.28]M: Well, most people I know start out with a very reasonable salary;
[07:53.06]you can earn pay increases depending on your performance.
[07:57.27]W: So, what about benefits?
[08:00.19]M: Oh, the benefits are pretty good.
[08:03.55]They provide health insurance, two weeks of paid vacation a year,
[08:07.68]and opportunities for advancement.
[08:10.53]W: Well, is there long-term job security in a job like that?
[08:14.87]M: Uhh. That's hard to tell.
[08:17.24]I mean, the Internet is booming,
[08:19.79]and these kinds of companies are sprouting up everywhere,
[08:23.39]which is a good thing, but just like the dot-com era,
[08:27.44]you never know how long things will last.
[08:30.37]W: Well, have you ever thought about going back to school
[08:33.89]to improve your job skills?
[08:36.03]M: What are you suggesting?
[08:37.87]W: You know, you did drop out of college.
[08:41.75]M: I know, I know, but I don't know.
[08:44.44]I'm just seeing my current job at McDonalds as a step up.
[08:48.60]I don't have the resources at the moment to do that;
[08:52.08]however, the job I am looking at will pay for some classes
[08:56.38]after I have been with the company for six months.
[08:59.39]W: Well, it looks like you have things planned out this time.
[09:03.19]M: If I last that long.
[09:07.92]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:13.92]8. In which field is the man desiring a job?
[09:33.35]9. What’s the future of the Internet industry according to the man?
[09:53.67]10. What do we learn from the conversation 
[09:57.29]about the man’s educational background?
[10:15.14]11. Why doesn’t the man go back to school right now?
[10:34.71]Conversation Two
[10:37.80]W: Okay. Mr. Smith. Let's begin your road test.
[10:41.20]M: Oh. I know I'm ready.
[10:43.15]I've been practicing in my driveway all week.
[10:46.13]W: Okay. Mr. Smith.
[10:48.07]As I'm sure you are aware,
[10:50.27]you will not only be tested on your knowledge of the rules of the road,
[10:54.26]but on your behavior toward other motorists.
[10:58.01]M: Yeah, right. Here we go!
[11:00.16]W: Whoa! Take it easy.
[11:02.31]The speed limit in this business district is only 25 miles an hour.
[11:07.95]Now, turn right at the next corner.
[11:10.99]Not here! Wow!You forgot to signal too!
[11:15.23]M: Gosh. I didn't see that one!
[11:18.23]W: Ah. Forget it. Just keep driving.
[11:21.30]M: So, how am I doing? Can I just take a peek at your notes?
[11:26.55]W: No! Watch out. Mr. Smith.
[11:29.15]Now you're tailgating the vehicle in front of us.
[11:32.69]M: Oh, yeah.
[11:33.89]I'm just so excited about getting my license today.
[11:38.10]W: Okay. Now carefully turn right here,
[11:41.19]and wait, wait, stop!
[11:44.28]You almost hit that pedestrian.
[11:47.14]How in the world did you pass the written test anyway?
[11:51.00]You have to give way to any pedestrians crossing the street.
[11:54.69]M: Oh, sorry about that. It won't happen again.
[11:58.93]W: Whoa! Get out! I'm driving back to the office.
[12:03.56]M: Does this mean I didn't pass the test?
[12:06.91]W: Look, Mr. Smith.
[12:08.52]Could you do me a favor?
[12:10.56]When you come back to take the test again, plan on coming on Friday.
[12:15.45]M: Again? Why? Is it less crowded that day?
[12:20.13]W: No. It's my day off.
[12:23.98]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:30.61]12. What has the man been preparing for in the past week?
[12:51.30]13. Where did the man begin his test?
[13:10.81]14. What mistake did the man almost make?
[13:30.76]15. What does the woman suggest at the end of the conversation?
[13:51.93]Section C
[13:53.32]Directions: In this section,
[13:56.92]you will hear three passages.
[13:58.86]At the end of each passage,
[14:00.36]you will hear some questions.
[14:02.37]Both the passage and the questions
[14:04.31]will be spoken only once.
[14:06.71]After you hear a question,
[14:08.40]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[14:11.30]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:15.60]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:19.12]with a single line through the centre.
[14:22.76]Passage One
[14:25.45]Elizabeth Blackwell, born in 1821 in Bristol, England,
[14:29.71]was the first woman awarded the M.D. degree.
[14:33.11]Many nineteenth-century physicians, including a few women,
[14:37.46]practiced without a degree, but Elizabeth Blackwell
[14:40.50]wished to attain full professional status.
[14:44.01]She applied to many medical schools.
[14:47.12]Sadly, all her applications were turned down,
[14:50.56]because at that time, only men were doctors.
[14:54.15]When she was finally accepted,
[14:56.21]the students and professors were cruel to her
[14:58.71]because she was the only woman at the school.
[15:01.86]Working with quiet determination,
[15:04.91]she turned aside the hostility of the professors,
[15:08.12]students, and townspeople.
[15:10.06]She earned her medical degree in 1849,
[15:13.64]but faced additional difficulties in setting up her practice.
[15:17.89]Barred from city hospitals, she founded her own infirmary.
[15:22.17]Eventually she founded a Women's Medical College
[15:25.31]to train other women physicians.
[15:27.79]Blackwell's educational standards
[15:29.72]were higher than the all-male medical schools.
[15:33.98]And she started the program of disease prevention in her schools.
[15:37.90]It was the first time the idea of preventing disease
[15:40.91]was taught at a medical college.
[15:43.79]Elizabeth helped do many things,
[15:46.42]such as establishing British National Health Society in 1871.
[15:52.20]Dr. Elizabeth died at her home in Hastings, England,
[15:56.60]in 1910, at the age of 89.
[16:00.33]She is remembered for her contributions to the cause of medicine
[16:04.07]and for showing the way for women to move on.
[16:09.12]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:14.58]16. What made Elizabeth Blackwell distinguished from physicians of her time?
[16:37.29]17. Why were Elizabeth's professors and fellow students hostile to her?
[16:58.97]18. What did Elizabeth contribute to the cause of medicine?
[17:19.89]Passage Two
[17:22.52]The northern parts of the United States get very cold in the winter.
[17:26.73]It snows a great deal and the temperature
[17:29.77]often goes below zero degrees in January, February and March.
[17:35.71]But the northeastern and north-central regions of the country
[17:39.45]have been financial and industrial centers,
[17:42.94]and they are heavily populated.
[17:45.49]In recent years, people in these regions
[17:48.34]have begun to take vacations during these cold winter months.
[17:52.57]They go to southern parts of the country where it is warmer.
[17:56.93]Many go to Florida where the weather is tropical.
[18:00.92]Others go to the southwestern states of Arizona,
[18:04.52]New Mexico and Texas
[18:06.56]where they find dry desert climates.
[18:09.65]It has become common, nowadays,
[18:12.38]for older people to move south to these places when they retire.
[18:16.94]Typically these people sell their houses in their home communities
[18:21.53]and move south to begin a new life as senior citizens.
[18:26.45]Their children likely have homes of their own,
[18:29.46]and many of them are moving south away from communities
[18:33.15]where they were raised.
[18:35.14]The southern and southwestern parts of the country
[18:37.80]are now growing faster than any other parts.
[18:41.49]Business and industry have opened many new offices and factories in the south.
[18:47.27]California is already the most popular state in the country.
[18:51.86]Texas and Florida are growing fast too.
[18:55.36]They may soon replace such states
[18:57.90]as New York and Pennsylvania in population.
[19:01.94]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:07.18]19. What does the speaker say about the northern parts of the United States?
[19:28.10]20. Why do some retirees sell their houses in their home communities?
[19:48.96]21. In which aspect will Texas and Florida surpass New York and Pennsylvania?
[20:11.52]Passage Three
[20:14.01]Germany's Rhine River is hundreds of miles long,
[20:17.41]but not all of it is the "Romantic Rhine" of guidebooks.
[20:21.80]The stretch of river where you can see castles, villages, and vineyards,
[20:26.09]runs 36 miles from Koblenz in the north to Bingen in the south.
[20:32.23]Visitors like coming to this part of Germany
[20:35.37]because the scenery is actually stunning.
[20:37.87]Whether you travel by car, train, or boat,
[20:40.72]you'll see high hills stretching away from the river,
[20:44.35]topped with castles and vineyards.
[20:46.59]Some of the castles are open for touring during the tourist season,
[20:51.03]while others are hotels, hostels, or the homes of some organizations.
[20:56.36]The best time to visit the Rhine is during the summer,
[20:59.86]when you can take full advantage of the sights.
[21:02.83]Traveling in a cruise yacht is more fun
[21:05.49]when you can sit in the open rather than down below.
[21:09.23]Of course, be prepared for tourist crowds during the summer.
[21:14.03]There are several ways to travel along the Rhine.
[21:17.32]Several river cruise companies offer tours.
[21:21.06]It takes about two hours to cruise from St. Goar to Bacharach,
[21:27.72]and most visitors agree this is the most scenic part of the Rhine River.
[21:32.87]You can also take the train that runs between the villages in the area,
[21:36.85]and stop anywhere along the way.
[21:39.54]Another option is to drive the highway that's on the banks of the river,
[21:43.87]or ride a bicycle along a trail.
[21:46.77]If cyclists or drivers want to get to the other side of the river,
[21:50.47]a number of ferries are available to get them across.
[21:55.51]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:00.98]22. Why do people like to visit Germany's Rhine River according to the speaker?
[22:23.43]23. What does the speaker say about the castles?
[22:43.55]24. What does the speaker remind summer visitors of?
[23:04.14]25. How can cyclists or drivers get across the Rhine River?
[23:25.26]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
