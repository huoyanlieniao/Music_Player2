[00:15.47]College English Test - Band 4
[00:18.82]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:23.69]Section A
[00:25.68]Directions: In this section,
[00:29.12]you will hear three news reports.
[00:32.25]At the end of each news report,
[00:34.94]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:38.37]Both the news report and the questions
[00:41.50]will be spoken only once.
[00:44.29]After you hear a question,
[00:46.18]you must choose the best answer
[00:48.66]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:54.69]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:59.02]with a single line through the centre.
[01:02.01]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[01:08.58]Got a smart phone? Never lose your hotel key,
[01:12.21]or even have to stop at the registration desk, again.
[01:15.55]That’s the vision of a hotel chain
[01:18.23]that plans to send digital keys to guests’ phone
[01:21.12]via an app instead of making them check in
[01:24.11]and get the traditional plastic swipe cards.
[01:27.19]Arriving guests could get around the front desk
[01:30.23]and go straight to their rooms.
[01:32.27]Starwood Hotels & Resorts,
[01:34.80]which owns more than 1,150 hotels in nearly 100 countries,
[01:40.63]plans to install the system in the next three months
[01:44.02]at two of its hotels in the U.S.A. If all goes well,
[01:48.20]the company says it could have the feature in all of its hotels by next year.
[01:53.97]A spokeswoman said the app will initially be compatible
[01:58.01]with recent iPhone models and newer Android phones.
[02:02.29]The app will use Bluetooth technology to unlock the room with a tap.
[02:07.52]1. What is the main advantage of the digital key?
[02:27.90]2. How many hotels will have the system in the next three months?
[02:49.27]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:55.47]A British man accused of planning his wife’s murder
[02:59.60]while they were honeymooning in South Africa
[03:02.14]has lost a High Court appeal to block his being sent back to Britain
[03:08.06]until he is fit to stand trial.
[03:10.75]The judges ruled that Shrien Dewani can be sent back
[03:15.33]as long as the South African government pledges to return him
[03:19.76]to the United Kingdom should he ultimately prove unfit to be tried.
[03:24.73]Dewani’s lawyers had urged that he should not be sent back
[03:28.82]while he was unfit to stand trial.
[03:31.45]He is being treated for a depressive illness.
[03:34.84]His legal team can appeal the decision at the Supreme Court.
[03:39.37]Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of criminals to kill his wife,
[03:44.19]Anni Dewani,
[03:46.08]during a taxi ride in Cape Town last November,
[03:49.12]just over two weeks after their wedding.
[03:52.26]3. What can we learn about Shrien Dewani
[03:56.68]according to the court ruling?
[04:13.01]4. What was Dewani accused of?
[04:31.43]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:38.61]Dozens of children at a Utah elementary school
[04:42.21]had their lunch trays taken away from them
[04:44.92]before they could take a bite this week.
[04:47.02]Salt Lake City School District officials said
[04:49.97]the trays were taken away at Utah Elementary School Tuesday
[04:53.65]because some students had negative balances
[04:56.50]in their accounts used to pay for lunches.
[04:59.24]But they admit the situation should have been handled differently.
[05:03.02]Instead of regular lunches,
[05:05.06]the students were given fruit and milk.
[05:07.59]“We don’t ever let kids go without any food entirely,”
[05:11.78]said Salt Lake City School District spokesman Jason Olsen.
[05:15.77]One mother said,
[05:17.50]she was “blindsided” when her daughter described
[05:20.45]what a school district official told her:
[05:23.02]“You don’t have any money in your account,
[05:25.93]so you can’t get lunch.”
[05:27.62]“There were a lot of tears,” she said,
[05:30.21]“and it was pretty upsetting for them.”
[05:32.55]The district said it started notifying parents
[05:35.84]about negative account balances Monday.
[05:38.33]But the mother said
[05:39.72]she and other parents were never told about the problem.
[05:43.76]5. Why were some children offered only fruit and milk for lunch?
[06:05.66]6. How did parents react to the school’s way of handling the situation?
[06:27.41]7. When were the parents informed of negative balances
[06:32.44]according to the district?
[06:49.13]Section B
[06:50.78]Directions: In this section,
[06:54.45]you will hear two long conversations.
[06:58.10]At the end of each conversation,
[07:00.58]you will hear four questions.
[07:03.11]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:06.31]will be spoken only once.
[07:09.09]After you hear a question,
[07:11.19]you must choose the best answer
[07:13.47]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:19.50]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:23.78]with a single line through the centre.
[07:27.40]Conversation One
[07:31.87]M: Hi, Diana. I'm surprised to see you on the city bus.
[07:35.80]Your car in the shop?
[07:37.44]W: No. I've just been thinking a lot about the environment lately.
[07:42.32]So I decided the air will be a lot cleaner
[07:45.30]if we all use public transport when we could.
[07:48.19]M: I'm sure you are right.
[07:49.43]The diesel bus isn't exactly pollution free.
[07:52.42]W: True. They'll be running a lot cleaner soon.
[07:55.85]We were just talking about that in my environmental engineering class.
[08:00.43]M: What could the city do?
[08:02.02]Install pollution filters in all their buses?
[08:04.61]W: They could,
[08:05.96]but those filters make the engines work harder
[08:09.04]and really cut down on the fuel efficiency.
[08:11.83]Instead, they found a way to make their engines more efficient.
[08:16.26]M: How?
[08:17.35]W: Well, there is a new insulator.
[08:20.09]And you spray a thick coat of it on the engine.
[08:23.22]M: An insulator?
[08:24.27]W: Yeah. What it does is reflect back the heat of burning fuel.
[08:30.09]So the fuel will burn much hotter and burn up more completely.
[08:34.52]M: So a lot less unburned fuel comes out to pollute the air.
[08:38.20]W: And the bus will need less fuel.
[08:41.25]So with the saving on fuel cost,
[08:43.63]they say this will all pay for itself in just six months.
[08:49.00]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[08:56.57]8. Why does Diana take a bus that day?
[09:15.41]9. What is true about Diana?
[09:34.63]10. What justifies the installation of a new insulator in the buses
[09:41.55]according to Diana?
[09:57.52]11. What is the major concern of the woman?
[10:17.38]Conversation Two
[10:20.06]M: Hi. I have a reservation for tonight.
[10:23.45]My name is Charles Nelson.
[10:25.29]W: Okay. Mr. Nelson.
[10:26.88]That's a room for five under your name.
[10:29.87]M: No. No. Hold on.
[10:31.36]There must be some mistake.
[10:32.80]W: Okay. Let's check this again.
[10:36.01]Okay, Mr. Charles C. Nelson for tonight...
[10:39.97]M: Ah. There's the problem.
[10:42.10]My name is Charles Nelson, not Charles C. Nelson.
[10:46.18]You must have two guests under the name.
[10:49.02]W: Okay. Let me check this again.
[10:51.80]Oh. Okay. Here we are.
[10:54.59]Charles Nelson. A room for one for the 19th...
[10:58.07]M: Wait, wait! It was for tonight.
[11:00.46]Not tomorrow night.
[11:01.75]W: Hum. Hum. I don't think we have any rooms for tonight.
[11:07.62]There's a convention going on in town,
[11:10.56]and uh, let's see. Yeah, no rooms.
[11:14.34]Well. We do have some rooms under renovation
[11:18.72]with just a roll-away bed.
[11:20.71]None of the normal stuff like a TV or working shower or toilet.
[11:25.49]M: Ah madam. Come on. There must be something else.
[11:28.18]W: Well. Let me check my computer here.
[11:31.56]Ah! There has been a cancellation for this evening.
[11:35.99]A honeymoon suite is now available.
[11:38.63]M: Great. I'll take it.
[11:40.57]W: But I'll have to charge you two hundred fifty dollars for the night.
[11:44.80]M: Ah. Madam. I should get a discount for the inconvenience.
[11:48.43]W: Well. The best I can give you is a ten percent discount
[11:53.06]plus a ticket for a free continental breakfast.
[11:58.33]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:05.84]12. What was the first problem with the man’s reservation?
[12:25.59]13. Why was it hard to get a room that day?
[12:45.08]14. What do we know about the rooms under renovation in the hotel?
[13:05.38]15. What did the man get finally?
[13:24.79]Section C
[13:26.83]Directions: In this section,
[13:30.66]you will hear three short passages.
[13:33.31]At the end of each passage,
[13:35.80]you will hear some questions.
[13:37.89]Both the passage and the questions
[13:40.73]will be spoken only once.
[13:43.51]After you hear a question,
[13:46.00]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[13:49.93]marked A), B), C) and D).
[13:54.38]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[13:58.61]with a single line through the centre.
[14:02.26]Passage One
[14:04.50]Television now plays such an important part in so many people's lives
[14:08.48]that it is essential for us to try to decide
[14:11.71]whether it is a blessing or a curse.
[14:14.65]Obviously television has both advantages and disadvantages.
[14:19.43]But do the former outweigh the latter?
[14:21.83]In the first place,
[14:23.31]television is not only a convenient source of entertainment,
[14:26.90]but also a comparatively cheap one.
[14:29.63]They just sit comfortably at home
[14:31.93]and enjoy endless series of programs
[14:34.21]rather than to go out in search of amusement elsewhere.
[14:37.80]Some people, however,
[14:39.46]maintain that this is precisely where the danger lies.
[14:42.80]The television viewer needs to do nothing.
[14:46.13]He is completely passive and has everything presented to him
[14:49.33]without any effort on his part.
[14:51.92]Secondly, television keeps one informed about current events,
[14:56.44]allows one to follow the latest developments
[14:59.22]in science and politics.
[15:00.86]Yet here again there is a danger.
[15:03.10]The television screen itself has a terrible,
[15:06.18]almost physical fascination for us.
[15:08.92]We get so used to looking at its movements,
[15:11.41]so dependent on its pictures that it begins to dominate our lives.
[15:15.84]There are many other arguments for and against television.
[15:19.47]The poor quality of its program is often criticized.
[15:23.65]But it is undoubtedly a great comfort to many lonely elderly people.
[15:28.48]And does it corrupt or instruct our children?
[15:31.81]I think we must realize that television in itself
[15:35.45]is neither good nor bad.
[15:37.99]It is the uses to which it is put that determine its value to society.
[15:44.46]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:50.89]16. What is NOT mentioned as the disadvantages of TV?
[16:12.37]17. What is the speaker's opinion of television?
[16:31.90]18. What determines the value of television to society?
[16:53.45]Passage Two
[16:55.72]Beethoven probably began to go deaf in 1797,
[17:01.14]but he tried to keep it a secret,
[17:03.63]while consulting doctors and trying various remedies,
[17:07.46]such as the application of almond oil.
[17:10.60]He was extremely anxious about its possible effect
[17:14.34]on his career as a musician,
[17:16.38]and embarrassed by its effect on his social life.
[17:20.11]In the summer of 1801 he wrote to two friends expressing the anxiety
[17:26.08]that his best years would pass
[17:28.87]"without my being able to achieve all that my talent
[17:32.38]and my strength have commanded me to do".
[17:35.37]Although tempted to kill himself,
[17:38.60]"the only thing that held me back was my art.
[17:41.74]For indeed it seemed to me impossible to leave this world
[17:46.31]before I had produced all the works
[17:49.00]that I felt the urge to compose".
[17:51.44]It could be argued that Beethoven's deafness
[17:55.27]helped the development of his art:
[17:57.40]isolated from the world, and unable to perform,
[18:01.59]he could devote all his time to composing.
[18:04.64]In 1804 his friend Stephan von Breuning,
[18:09.37]with whom he briefly shared lodgings,
[18:11.90]wrote to Franz Wegler about the terrible effect
[18:15.84]his gradual loss of hearing was having on Beethoven:
[18:19.77]it had caused him to distrust his friends,
[18:22.52]and he was becoming very difficult to be with.
[18:25.90]But above all else, Beethoven was dedicated to his art
[18:31.03]and the urge to compose remained with him throughout his life.
[18:34.96]It may be that he shielded away from the commitment of marriage
[18:39.65]because he knew it would interfere with his art.
[18:44.85]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:50.39]19. Why did Beethoven try to conceal his going deaf?
[19:10.18]20. What was the result from Beethoven's gradual loss of hearing in 1804?
[19:30.82]21. What do we know about Beethoven in this passage?
[19:50.53]Passage Three
[19:52.67]Over the years, new technologies have changed farming.
[19:56.90]Change in a general direction is a trend.
[20:00.63]Yet people often recognize trends
[20:03.52]only when they consider the past.
[20:05.76]Today, we look back at some trends in American agriculture.
[20:10.09]In 1920, America had more than 25 million horses and mules.
[20:15.67]Most were used for farm work.
[20:18.21]Around the same time,
[20:19.75]a competitor began to appear in large numbers.
[20:23.18]Tractors could turn soil, pull loads and speed harvests
[20:27.71]―and they could do it better.
[20:29.36]More tractors meant fewer horses and mules.
[20:32.94]By the 1960s, the numbers of these work animals settled
[20:37.55]to where they remain today.
[20:39.59]That is about one-tenth the levels in 1920.
[20:43.58]Yet even the demand for tractors had its limits.
[20:47.16]Their numbers have been slowly decreasing since 1982.
[20:51.44]Experts say farmers can do more with less now
[20:55.62]because of new technologies.
[20:57.76]As tractors replaced horses and mules,
[21:00.20]farmers no longer needed to raise crops to feed work animals.
[21:04.83]Oats have long been food for horses and mules.
[21:08.51]In 1954, American farmers planted
[21:12.19]over sixteen million hectares of oats.
[21:15.17]By 2000, that was down to less than one million hectares.
[21:19.35]So what did the farmers do with the extra land?
[21:22.36]More and more farmers began to plant a new crop
[21:25.79]around the same time
[21:27.14]that the tractor became popular. It was the soybean.
[21:30.92]The soybean is one of the oldest plants harvested.
[21:34.85]Yet it was not planted widely in the United States until the 1920s.
[21:39.88]By the year 2000,
[21:41.58]close to 30 million hectares were planted with soybeans.
[21:45.16]It is the nation's most important crop
[21:47.85]for high-protein animal feed and for vegetable oil.
[21:51.33]In fact, soybeans are the second most valuable crop grown
[21:55.20]by American farmers after corn.
[21:58.40]Much of the soybean production goes to exports.
[22:04.37]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:10.89]22. In which year did tractors begin to appear in large numbers?
[22:31.35]23. How many horses and mules did America have in the 1960s?
[22:53.14]24. What is America's most important crop
[22:58.82]for high-protein animal feed and for vegetable oil?
[23:17.18]25. What is the most valuable crop grown by American farmers?
[23:37.09]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
