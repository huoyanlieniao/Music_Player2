[00:15.34]College English Test - Band 4
[00:18.72]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:22.30]Section A
[00:24.34]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.48]you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.87]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.56]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:34.24]Both the news report and the questions
[00:36.33]will be spoken only once.
[00:38.77]After you hear a question,
[00:40.76]you must choose the best answer
[00:42.41]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:46.88]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:50.62]with a single line through the centre.
[00:53.45]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:57.93]It is the end of the road for these broken,
[01:00.72]outdated and unwanted electronics.
[01:03.61]Seoul city throws out some 10 tons of e-waste each year,
[01:08.29]and about a fifth of that arrives at this recycling center.
[01:11.93]But it is not just about earning profits,
[01:14.28]says the center’s CEO Ji.
[01:16.62]It is about protecting the environment.
[01:19.31]“Our planet has a limited amount of natural resources,” he said.
[01:23.49]“Our company contributes to a sustainable society,
[01:26.83]by preserving these materials.”
[01:28.87]Ji says about 90 percent of what is brought here gets recycled.
[01:33.05]Accumulating large piles of electronic trash is not only a concern
[01:38.03]in technologically-advanced South Korea.
[01:40.92]The United Nations reports
[01:42.91]millions of tons of the world’s e-waste winds up in developing countries.
[01:47.85]There,
[01:49.19]poisonous materials like lead and mercury pose a severe health risk.
[01:53.72]That is despite international agreements
[01:56.75]that ban the export of discarded electronics.
[02:01.37]1. What is the purpose of recycling e-waste in Seoul’s recycling center?
[02:22.83]2. Why do international agreements ban the export
[02:28.21]of discarded electronics?
[02:44.52]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:50.46]UNICEF says more than 3,700 children across west Africa
[02:56.19]have lost one or both parents to Ebola.
[03:00.27]“Doctors without borders” Axelle Vandoornick said
[03:04.24]the growing number of Ebola orphans is a crisis of its own.
[03:08.72]Child care services in Sierra Leone are almost nonexistent.
[03:13.75]Ministry of health social services officer Doris Mansare is in charge
[03:19.95]of running Kailahun's first Ebola children center for orphans.
[03:25.47]She said “it’s difficult for us to find family members,
[03:29.95]so this temporary care center was established
[03:33.33]to basically insure that we get the children from the treatment center.”
[03:38.46]Vandoornick said it can be hard to find surviving family.
[03:43.04]Ebola is wiping out entire families
[03:46.54]because the disease spread inside the families easily.
[03:50.97]Doris said
[03:52.51]she hopes the new center will help the growing number of orphans,
[03:56.84]but she worries about their future.
[03:58.93]Vandoornick hopes
[04:00.69]there will be many child care centers set up across Sierra Leone.
[04:06.87]3. How many kids have lost parents to Ebola in West Africa?
[04:27.53]4. What is Vandoornick’s hope?
[04:45.68]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:51.58]A new study says the speed and severity of climate change
[04:55.31]could cause major damage to small African farms.
[04:58.99]These farmers are already struggling to deal
[05:01.98]with the effects of climate change.
[05:03.99]The study was released at the African green revolution forum
[05:07.38]in Addis Ababa.
[05:09.47]It is called the African Agriculture Status Report.
[05:12.81]Small-scale farmers are the major support for African agriculture.
[05:17.69]About 70-percent of the rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa
[05:22.58]are small-scale farmers.
[05:24.67]They produce about 80-percent of the food need in Africa.
[05:29.38]About 90-precent of these farms are rain-fed,
[05:32.91]which means that they depend on the weather.
[05:35.45]Weather is rainfall.
[05:37.14]Weather is drought.
[05:38.68]Weather is an increase in temperature.
[05:41.22]They are more exposed to these climate effects
[05:44.19]than any other part of the world.
[05:46.13]On top of that most of them use their own labor or family labor.
[05:50.56]They are not mechanized.
[05:52.55]The report says farmers in sub-Saharan Africa are also dealing
[05:57.13]with rising temperatures.
[05:58.92]This major rise in temperature brings a lot of issues to Africa food security.
[06:04.15]It is going to affect reduction in yield,
[06:07.23]increase invulnerability to harmful insects and diseases
[06:10.65]that will kill most of the domestic animals.
[06:14.87]5. What will cause serious damage to small African farms?
[06:36.06]6. What do we learn about African agriculture from the news report?
[06:56.45]7. What will rising temperatures affect the farmers’ life?
[07:16.92]Section B
[07:18.76]Directions: In this section,
[07:21.70]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:24.14]At the end of each conversation,
[07:26.18]you will hear four questions.
[07:28.12]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:30.56]will be spoken only once.
[07:32.40]After you hear a question,
[07:34.24]you must choose the best answer
[07:36.04]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:41.58]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:45.17]with a single line through the centre.
[07:48.50]Conversation One
[07:51.17]W: I'm sorry,
[07:52.92]but I can't let you check out these books.
[07:55.85]M: What do you mean?
[07:58.00]W: Wow, the computer shows you got an overdue book,
[08:02.33]art work, out since last September.
[08:05.71]M: But that's impossible.
[08:07.45]I only started going to this school last month
[08:10.94]and I'm a business major, not an artist.
[08:14.27]W: Oh. This is pretty strange.
[08:17.21]Let me look out the records.
[08:19.99]OK. You are Richard Smith?
[08:23.43]M: Yeah.
[08:24.62]W: You live at fifty thirty-three western?
[08:27.71]M: No, I am living on campus,
[08:30.40]in the new...
[08:31.15]W: You did say you are Richard Smith, right?
[08:34.58]M: Yeah, well,
[08:36.32]my full name is Richard James Smith,
[08:39.36]but I usually go by Richard Smith.
[08:42.00]W: Let me check one more thing on the computer.
[08:45.48]Aha, I see now.
[08:48.17]There's another Richard Smith in the class...
[08:51.76]Richard El Smith.
[08:54.39]And it looks like he's the one
[08:56.52]who got the overdue book checked out.
[08:59.51]M: Another Richard Smith?
[09:01.55]No kidding.
[09:02.74]W: So I guess you two never met.
[09:05.23]M: No, but I think I should probably try.
[09:09.16]I could at least warn him what's just happened.
[09:12.44]W: Good idea.
[09:13.64]Now I'll let you check out these books today.
[09:17.07]But I suggest you start using your middle name,
[09:20.81]or mid initial to avoid any problem like this in the future.
[09:26.83]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:32.05]8. Why is the man talking to the woman?
[09:51.47]9. Why does the man mention that he is a new student at the school?
[10:12.03]10. What does the woman discover
[10:16.11]when she looks at the records on her computer?
[10:33.83]11. What does the woman suggest the man do in the future?
[10:54.06]Conversation Two
[10:56.44]M: Belinda,
[10:58.18]the game will begin soon.
[11:00.02]W: I can't wait to watch the game, Martin.
[11:03.21]This is the first time I've ever been to a soccer game at a stadium.
[11:08.14]I always watch them on TV at home.
[11:11.62]M: This is not a soccer game.
[11:14.26]It's football. American football.
[11:17.19]W: You mean it's a rugby game?
[11:20.23]M: No, no, no.
[11:21.72]You've got them all wrong...
[11:23.56]The game is on. Look!
[11:26.35]They use an elliptic ball in an American football match.
[11:30.68]They can also pass the ball with their hands.
[11:33.91]W: I see.
[11:35.26]Soccer uses a round ball
[11:37.45]and the players can't touch the ball with their hands.
[11:40.74]Is that right?
[11:42.33]M: You're smarter than I thought.
[11:44.42]Now watch the game.
[11:46.51]W: Oh, that is violent!
[11:48.75]M: What are you talking about?
[11:50.69]It's exciting.
[11:52.33]W: Listen, Martin. I can't stand this.
[11:55.42]I don't like American football at all.
[11:58.15]I came here only because I thought
[12:00.74]this was going to be a soccer game.
[12:03.18]M: Don't be silly, Belinda.
[12:05.42]You'll love it.
[12:06.81]It's just begun.
[12:08.36]W: Please. I want to go home.
[12:10.89]M: All right, all right.
[12:12.69]This is crazy.
[12:14.53]What will my friends say about this?
[12:17.02]W: You can stay if you want.
[12:18.87]I can go home by myself.
[12:23.12]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:29.48]12. What kind of game are the speakers watching?
[12:48.73]13. What do we learn about American football from the conversation?
[13:08.95]14. What do the two speakers think of American football and soccer?
[13:30.06]15. Why did the woman come to watch the game?
[13:49.95]Section C
[13:51.64]Directions: In this section,
[13:54.88]you will hear three short passages.
[13:56.82]At the end of each passage,
[13:58.56]you will hear some questions.
[14:00.25]Both the passage and the questions
[14:02.39]will be spoken only once.
[14:04.43]After you hear a question,
[14:06.37]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[14:09.34]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:13.67]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:17.15]with a single line through the centre.
[14:20.42]Passage One
[14:21.98]Cambridge is about 90 kilometres northeast of London.
[14:26.51]It is one of the most beautiful places in Britain.
[14:30.59]Everything about the city of Cambridge
[14:34.03]reminds you of its famous university:
[14:37.12]students on bicycles,
[14:39.41]the atmosphere of learning,
[14:41.50]traditions and the magnificent buildings of the 30 colleges
[14:45.68]that are in the University of Cambridge.
[14:48.02]Most of the colleges stand on the bank of the Cam River,
[14:53.44]a gentle river that flows through the heart of the city.
[14:57.77]Tourists and students like boating in a kind of flat-bottom boat
[15:03.13]to see the colleges or to relax themselves.
[15:07.16]If the water traffic reminds the visitors of Venice,
[15:11.34]the road traffic here is more likely
[15:14.33]to recall Beijing or Amsterdam.
[15:17.66]The streets are full of bicycles,
[15:20.80]hundreds and hundreds of them.
[15:23.49]They provide a cheap form of transport for the students
[15:28.07]and a very convenient way of getting
[15:31.25]around the streets in Cambridge.
[15:34.87]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:40.84]16. What is the speaker's impression of Cambridge?
[16:00.16]17. What do tourists enjoy doing in Cambridge for relaxation?
[16:20.41]18. Why did the road traffic in Cambridge remind people of Beijing?
[16:40.98]Passage Two
[16:42.97]Mr. Foster started his publishing business
[16:46.01]with only one magazine.
[16:48.25]It was called World News.
[16:50.93]Mostly it had summaries of important week events
[16:55.16]from around the world.
[16:57.06]But it always included one or two stories about interesting people.
[17:03.38]Mr. Foster put these in because he believed
[17:06.76]all people like to read about other people.
[17:10.85]Several years ago,
[17:12.69]Mr. Foster started two magazines.
[17:15.49]One was called Enterprise.
[17:18.33]It is for business people.
[17:20.56]And the other was called Action,
[17:23.50]for sports fans.
[17:24.99]Like World News,
[17:27.97]they always have two or three stories
[17:31.08]about interesting people.
[17:33.47]Five years ago,
[17:34.76]Mr. Foster got another idea for a magazine.
[17:38.51]He wanted this one to have even more stories
[17:41.70]about people than the others and to have more photographs.
[17:47.81]This one was named Faces and Places.
[17:51.64]From the very beginning,
[17:53.73]it was a big success.
[17:56.27]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:02.49]19. What is Mr. Foster's profession?
[18:21.35]20. Why did Mr. Foster add stories about interesting people
[18:26.97]to the magazine World News?
[18:44.01]21. Who would be interested in the magazine Action,
[18:49.25]according to the passage?
[19:06.43]Passage Three
[19:08.47]Joe is a student at a college in an urban area.
[19:12.56]During his first two semesters,
[19:15.64]he did very well and at the beginning of the third semester
[19:20.02]he was admitted to a special medical program.
[19:23.80]If he completed the program successfully,
[19:27.24]he would be granted admission to a good medical school.
[19:31.76]He would be able to study to become a doctor.
[19:36.14]Joe's mother and father both have full-time jobs
[19:40.46]and Joe works part-time in a restaurant
[19:43.28]to help the family finances.
[19:46.02]Several weeks ago,
[19:48.35]Joe's mother began feeling sharp chest pains.
[19:51.79]When she went to a doctor,
[19:54.33]he told her that she would need a heart surgery
[19:57.66]and would have to give up her job.
[20:00.50]This would enlarge medical expenses
[20:03.78]and lose almost half the family's income.
[20:08.03]Joe's father wants him to drop out of school
[20:12.34]and go to work full-time to help the family.
[20:16.32]Joe loves his family very much.
[20:19.91]But, if he drops out now,
[20:23.04]he would lose the entire semester's credit
[20:26.49]and may even lose his place in the premedical program.
[20:31.36]He doesn't know what to do.
[20:34.00]He speaks to his girlfriend Maria
[20:37.09]who urges him to remain in school
[20:40.22]since to withdraw now would place his entire future in danger.
[20:46.14]He also speaks to his cousin Carol,
[20:49.58]who tells him that his first duty
[20:52.02]is to help his family get through the difficult times.
[20:56.99]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[21:02.98]22. When was Joe admitted to the special medical program?
[21:23.05]23. Why would Joe's mother give up her job?
[21:42.79]24. Who advised Joe to give up his studies?
[22:01.97]25. What is Joe going to do?
[22:20.39]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[22:23.63]
