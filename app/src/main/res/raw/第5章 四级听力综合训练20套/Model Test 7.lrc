[00:15.39]College English Test - Band 4
[00:18.98]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:23.86]Section A
[00:25.85]Directions: In this section,
[00:29.53]you will hear three news reports.
[00:32.52]At the end of each news report,
[00:35.05]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:38.66]Both the news report and the questions
[00:41.54]will be spoken only once.
[00:44.38]After you hear a question,
[00:46.17]you must choose the best answer
[00:48.61]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:54.63]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:59.12]with a single line through the centre.
[01:02.51]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[01:09.38]Last night,
[01:10.53]eight million people in 16 U.S. states were under a flood warning.
[01:16.00]It was what remained of a heavy storm system
[01:19.21]that struck in late December,
[01:21.45]stretching from New Mexico to Michigan and going its way east.
[01:25.78]It brought several powerful tornadoes to Texas,
[01:29.27]destroying homes and buildings near Dallas.
[01:32.70]Hailstorms, snowstorms,
[01:35.24]hundreds of flight cancellations hit the central part of the country
[01:39.53]and dozens of people died in the severe conditions
[01:42.71]brought by the system.
[01:44.40]For some, the worst of it came well after the storm hit,
[01:48.59]as flood waters flowed in the rivers,
[01:51.27]they covered their banks and spilled through communities.
[01:55.29]The Mississippi flooded parts of Illinois
[01:58.13]and its swollen water slowly spread out
[02:00.30]along the Mississippi southern part.
[02:02.83]It’s not expected to reach its highest point in Memphis,
[02:06.57]Tennessee, until January 9th.
[02:10.71]1. What’s the news report mainly about?
[02:29.40]2. What do we learn about the storm system
[02:33.79]from the news report?
[02:49.48]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:57.39]We’re starting today with a report on a major earthquake
[03:00.73]that struck Southern Asia yesterday.
[03:03.23]Its center,
[03:04.07]the point directly above the quake,
[03:06.11]was in northeastern Afghanistan.
[03:08.70]The force was felt in neighboring Pakistan and Tajikistan,
[03:12.63]as well as two countries over in India.
[03:15.42]Its level was 7.5,
[03:17.36]capable of huge damage.
[03:19.24]But geologists say because its center was so deep,
[03:22.65]more than 130 miles below the surface,
[03:25.74]its effects were limited.
[03:27.73]Still, Afghan officials say more than 4,000 houses were severely damaged
[03:32.91]or destroyed and more than 200 people, mostly in Pakistan,
[03:37.43]were confirmed dead when we produced this show.
[03:40.87]The quake hit a rural mountainous area.
[03:43.46]Some affected villages are hard for rescuers to reach.
[03:47.29]They also don’t have good basic constructions
[03:50.42]like solid bridges or reliable communications systems.
[03:54.31]So, that’s another challenge.
[03:58.38]3. Why was the effect of the earthquake limited?
[04:18.35]4. What was the consequence of the earthquake?
[04:37.20]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:45.01]Scientists say a huge percentage of bird species are in danger
[04:49.84]because their habitats, or homelands, are disappearing.
[04:53.72]Traditional migration paths take birds through countries
[04:57.65]that are not protecting locations to stop, rest and feed.
[05:02.43]The scientists studied the migration, or flight, paths,
[05:06.47]of almost 1,500 species.
[05:09.40]They decided that 91 percent of them passed through dangerous areas.
[05:14.94]The major danger for migratory birds is development.
[05:19.17]Building and paving has covered over nature
[05:22.41]where birds stop and feed
[05:24.32]as they move from one part of the world to another.
[05:27.60]For example,
[05:29.04]a bird called the bar-tailed godwit migrates
[05:32.07]from its breeding grounds in the Arctic.
[05:34.56]It flies all the way to the southern hemisphere
[05:37.19]in Australia and New Zealand.
[05:39.75]Along the way,
[05:41.19]the small birds stop at Yellow Sea mudflats in China,
[05:44.73]North Korea and South Korea.
[05:47.43]One of the scientists who worked on the study says
[05:50.22]“many of these critical sites have been lost to land reuse owing to urban,
[05:55.79]industrial and agricultural expansion.”
[06:01.12]5. Why are bird species in danger according to the news report?
[06:21.15]6. What do we learn about migratory birds from the news?
[06:41.15]7. What is the reason for the lost of critical sites for migratory birds?
[07:02.20]Section B
[07:04.93]Directions: In this section,
[07:08.42]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:11.85]At the end of each conversation,
[07:14.64]you will hear four questions.
[07:16.78]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:20.24]will be spoken only once.
[07:22.88]After you hear a question,
[07:24.92]you must choose the best answer
[07:27.36]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:33.53]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:37.74]with a single line through the centre.
[07:41.38]Conversation One
[07:44.94]W: English Language Center.
[07:47.28]May I help you?
[07:48.63]M: Yes. I'm calling to find out
[07:51.56]more information about your program.
[07:54.30]For example,
[07:55.64]what kind of courses do you offer?
[07:58.53]W: Well, first of all,
[08:00.68]the purpose of our program is
[08:02.32]to provide language learning opportunities for this area's community,
[08:07.55]whether a student's goal is to master basic functional language skills,
[08:12.57]let's say, for his or her job,
[08:15.21]or to study intensively to enter a US college or university.
[08:20.54]M: Okay. I'm calling for a friend
[08:23.01]who is interested in attending a US university.
[08:26.59]W: And that's the kind of, uh,
[08:28.32]instruction that we provide,
[08:30.86]from basic communication courses
[08:33.33]to content-based classes such as computer literacy,
[08:37.46]intercultural communication,
[08:39.80]and business English.
[08:42.19]M: Great. What are your application deadlines for the next semester?
[08:46.42]W: Well, we ask applicants to apply no later
[08:49.96]than two months before the semester begins.
[08:53.29]This gives us time to process the application and issue the student's I-20.
[08:59.63]M: An I-20?
[09:01.42]W: Oh, an I-20 is a form that indicates that
[09:05.06]we are giving permission for the student to study in our program,
[09:08.94]and then the student takes this form
[09:11.78]to the US embassy in his or her home country
[09:15.46]to apply for the F-1 student visa.
[09:18.79]M: All right.
[09:19.74]What is the tuition for a full-time student?
[09:23.42]W: It's two thousand thirty dollars.
[09:26.16]M: And how does one apply?
[09:28.00]W: Well, we can send you an application
[09:30.79]and you can mail it back to us,
[09:33.03]or you can fill out our application that's on our Web site.
[09:39.60]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:46.92]8. Why does the man make the phone call?
[10:06.09]9. What is one course taught at the English Language Center?
[10:26.15]10. What do we learn from the conversation
[10:30.88]about English Language Center?
[10:47.80]11. What is the tuition for a full-time student?
[11:07.55]Conversation Two
[11:11.14]W: Hello, Mr. Cooper.
[11:13.83]I'm Lina Redner,
[11:15.72]sales representative for Scarecrow Advertising Company.
[11:20.62]M: I don't think we have an appointment.
[11:23.26]W: No, we don't.
[11:25.06]You'll have to excuse me for this.
[11:27.49]M: Since you are already here,
[11:29.23]what can I do for you?
[11:31.04]W: Well, as far as I know,
[11:33.41]your company was founded three years ago
[11:36.20]and your business has been quite good for the past two years.
[11:40.38]M: I'm quite busy, Miss Redner.
[11:43.02]If you don't mind,
[11:44.13]just get straight to the point.
[11:46.07]W: OK. I believe that you must have seen a lot of S.A.C.
[11:50.75]designed TV commercials and billboards,
[11:53.49]and if we cooperate,
[11:55.83]it'll certainly make your products better known and sold.
[11:59.71]What do you think?
[12:01.40]M: I'm quite satisfied with the company
[12:03.79]that designs our advertisements at present.
[12:06.48]W: Don't say no for no's sake, please.
[12:10.01]Here are some samples of our designs.
[12:12.80]Have a look, if you please.
[12:15.34]M: All right...
[12:16.78]They're pretty good but...
[12:19.78]W: The payment we ask for is very reasonable.
[12:23.02]Besides, you won't have the bondage of a contract.
[12:26.99]If you're not satisfied with us,
[12:29.38]we'll refund the money.
[12:31.47]But, of course,
[12:33.08]such a thing has never happened.
[12:35.52]We'll redo the commercial or billboard
[12:38.14]over and over again until you're satisfied.
[12:42.57]M: There's no harm in giving it a try, I think.
[12:46.20]Leave your card.
[12:47.79]I'll call you when the next new product is ready to go on the market.
[12:55.14]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[13:03.56]12. What is the woman trying to do in the conversation?
[13:23.14]13. What’s the man’s reaction to the woman’s words?
[13:43.25]14. What do we know about the man’s company?
[14:02.38]15. What do we know about the service of the woman’s company?
[14:22.49]Section C
[14:25.03]Directions: In this section,
[14:28.46]you will hear three short passages.
[14:30.95]At the end of each passage,
[14:33.44]you will hear some questions.
[14:35.53]Both the passage and the questions
[14:38.37]will be spoken only once.
[14:41.25]After you hear a question,
[14:43.59]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[14:47.77]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:52.35]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:56.58]with a single line through the centre.
[14:59.85]Passage One
[15:03.04]Snakes may be found just about everywhere
[15:06.28]except the North Pole region
[15:08.52]and some islands in the South Pacific Ocean.
[15:12.25]Some snakes live in warm, dry deserts.
[15:16.23]Others live in green forests,
[15:18.77]fields and woodlands.
[15:21.83]Some never go far from water and are fine swimmers.
[15:26.88]Some live all their lives in the sea.
[15:30.50]Most snakes can swim.
[15:33.33]Because snakes are cold-blooded
[15:35.45]and depend on warm air for comfort and existence,
[15:40.03]the largest number of snakes is found
[15:42.46]in the hottest parts of the earth.
[15:46.79]Even so, many snakes stay away
[15:49.68]from the direct rays of the sun when possible.
[15:53.66]If extra hot weather comes along,
[15:56.79]snakes find a coolest place possible and stay there.
[16:01.02]In places where it freezes,
[16:03.91]snakes often hide themselves far
[16:06.45]under the ground or in caves and stay until spring.
[16:11.70]Snakes are smart enough to stay alive.
[16:15.43]They are smart enough to find food and kill their enemies.
[16:20.38]But compared with other animals,
[16:22.72]they are believed to be below average in intelligence.
[16:27.29]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:33.31]16. In which of the following places have snakes never been found?
[16:54.25]17. Why do we find the largest number of snakes in hot regions?
[17:15.21]18. How smart are snakes compared with other animals?
[17:36.08]Passage Two
[17:39.30]One day, John was doing some shopping in the market
[17:43.72]when he noticed a beautiful young woman there.
[17:47.36]She was very well dressed and he watched her
[17:50.78]as she walked round,
[17:52.83]looking at the fruit and vegetables which were for sale.
[17:57.30]The market was very crowded,
[17:59.85]but this woman was so graceful that she stood out in the crowd.
[18:05.57]"She looks like a film star," thought John to himself.
[18:10.65]Suddenly a thief ran through the crowd
[18:14.33]and seized the woman's bag and ran away.
[18:17.57]She screamed.
[18:19.71]John ran as quickly as he could to the nearest phone box.
[18:24.58]He dialed 999.
[18:27.72]"Please, come to the market square at once,"
[18:31.05]he asked the police,
[18:33.24]"A thief has run off with a lady's bag."
[18:37.32]John then returned to the market
[18:39.77]to try to calm the young woman.
[18:42.36]However, the thief had already returned
[18:45.59]and was talking to the young woman.
[18:48.33]They explained to John that they were only making a film.
[18:53.38]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:59.15]19. What was John doing when he saw the young woman?
[19:19.58]20. What made the woman stand out in the crowd?
[19:38.23]21. Why did the thief return?
[19:56.78]Passage Three
[19:59.91]Have you ever traveled on any of the giant jet airplanes?
[20:05.10]If you have not been a passenger on one of these planes,
[20:09.68]try to imagine a jet which is more than 70 meters long
[20:14.95]and more than 5 stories high at the tail.
[20:18.73]Such a plane costs at least 25 million dollars to build.
[20:25.00]It costs at least $6,000 to fill this giant with fuel.
[20:30.63]Inside, the jet looks more like a great theatre than a plane.
[20:36.15]It has 6 kitchens.
[20:38.99]They are all needed when the plane is full.
[20:42.32]The jet can hold more than 400 passengers.
[20:46.85]Imagine that number in one jet plane.
[20:50.98]Is there any danger that the jet's engines will fail?
[20:55.66]Fortunately, the planes appear to be quite safe.
[20:59.49]On each plane,
[21:01.03]there are twice as many engines as it needs.
[21:04.67]If two engines fail on the same side,
[21:08.60]the plane can easily use its other engines to land.
[21:13.03]There are also two mechanical pilots to take charge,
[21:18.20]if the human pilots cannot fly the plane.
[21:22.33]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[21:29.20]22. How much does it cost to build the giant jet?
[21:48.73]23. What does the giant jet look like inside?
[22:08.75]24. What do we learn about the engines of the giant jet plane?
[22:30.20]25. What will happen if the human pilot cannot fly the plane?
[22:51.07]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
