[00:15.34]College English Test - Band 4
[00:19.15]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:21.79]Section A
[00:24.14]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.58]you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.58]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.68]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:33.83]Both the news report and the questions
[00:36.35]will be spoken only once.
[00:38.53]After you hear a question,
[00:40.53]you must choose the best answer
[00:42.10]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:46.50]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:49.88]with a single line through the centre.
[00:52.89]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
Just because a toy’s packaging says it’s educational doesn’t make it so. 
[01:03.31]That’s the finding from a new study in JAMA Pediatrics 
[01:07.51]that found some toys being marketed 
[01:09.91]as language promoters got in the way of learning.
[01:13.40]Research shows that for kids to understand, 
[01:16.21]speak and eventually read or write a language, 
[01:19.28]they need to hear it---lots of it. 
[01:21.57]And it’s never too early for parents and caregivers to get talking. 
[01:25.56]That explains the booming industry in talking electronic toys 
[01:29.96]that claim to help kids learn language. 
[01:32.87]The study focused on roughly two-dozen children 
[01:35.87]between the ages of 10 and 16 months old. 
[01:38.82]Researchers outfitted them 
[01:40.78]with little microphones tucked into special vests 
[01:43.59]or shirts that could record the infants playing at home 
[01:46.84]with Mom or Dad.
[01:50.57]1. What’s the finding of the new study in JAMA Pediatrics?
[02:11.89]2. How many children does the research focus on?
[02:33.09]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:37.83]In the last few years, 
[02:39.52]the face of undocumented immigration to the U.S. 
[02:43.12]has changed and so has the business of human smuggling. 
[02:47.82]Make no mistake, 
[02:49.17]migrating illegally across the U.S.-Mexico border is a well established, 
[02:54.78]booming business. 
[02:56.27]Today on the show, 
[02:57.78]we meet a businessman and a client 
[03:00.12]in the evolving industry of human smuggling.
[03:03.79]For some context consider the changes in recent years: 
[03:08.61]Mexican immigrants have actually been leaving America. 
[03:13.13]Meanwhile, Central American immigration is on the rise. 
[03:17.47]This shift caused alarm when unaccompanied children from Honduras, 
[03:22.32]El Salvador and Guatemala started showing up 
[03:25.86]at the border seeking shelter. 
[03:28.20]A new wave of people were making their way up through Mexico, 
[03:31.97]trying to cross rivers and deserts to escape poverty and gang violence. 
[03:37.46]And many of the people doing this were paying dearly for it.
[03:43.94]3. What do we learn about the industry of human smuggling 
[03:48.48]in the U.S.-Mexico border?
[04:05.25]4. Whose immigration to America is on the rise?
[04:25.57]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:30.59]Tucked inside the U.S. government’s latest update 
[04:33.28]to its official eating advice is this recommendation: 
[04:37.23]“Drink water instead of sugary drinks”---also known as soda.
[04:41.90]The frankness of this statement is remarkable, 
[04:44.76]in part, 
[04:45.34]because the Dietary Guidelines released Thursday are, 
[04:48.36]in other ways, 
[04:49.31]anything but direct. 
[04:50.86]For instance, 
[04:51.97]as we’ve reported, 
[04:53.01]instead of explicitly telling Americans to cut their intake of red 
[04:57.06]and processed meats, 
[04:58.46]as an advisory panel of nutrition experts had recommended, 
[05:02.06]the final guidelines hint at meat reduction in subtle terms. 
[05:06.60]That change in messaging may have been linked 
[05:09.69]to pressure from the meat industry.
[05:11.68]By contrast, 
[05:13.00]the government’s language on choosing water over sugary drinks 
[05:16.65]is as clear as a glass of pure water. 
[05:19.63]It is not, however, all that easy to find. 
[05:22.73]We spotted it inside this MyPlate, 
[05:25.54]My Wins tip sheet, 
[05:27.20]part of a new campaign the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
[05:30.69]also launched Thursday.
[05:32.69]MyPlate, if you recall, 
[05:34.20]is the symbol of a dinner plate 
[05:36.38]divided into portions of fruits and vegetables, grains and proteins 
[05:40.61]that replaced the food pyramid released four years ago. 
[05:44.05]MyPlate is for the general public. 
[05:46.80]It’s an image that ends up in nutrition education materials 
[05:50.29]in doctor’s offices, 
[05:51.60]textbooks, school cafeterias and lots of other places.
[05:57.43]5. What’s the U.S. government’s latest official eating advice?
[06:19.35]6. Why does the final guide hint at meat reduction in subtle terms?
[06:41.59]7. What’s the target group of MyPlate?
[07:01.06]Section B
[07:02.45]Directions: In this section,
[07:05.19]you will hear two long conversations.                  
[07:07.34]At the end of each conversation,
[07:09.63]you will hear four questions.
[07:11.48]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:14.03]will be spoken only once.
[07:16.13]After you hear a question,
[07:17.77]you must choose the best answer
[07:19.51]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:24.79]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:28.48]with a single line through the centre.
[07:31.18]Conversation One
[07:34.13]M: I really don't know what to do this summer.
[07:36.86]I can't afford to just sit around,
[07:38.90]and there don't seem to be any jobs available.
[07:42.04]W: Why don't you try house-sitting?
[07:44.38]Last summer my friend Margaret house-sat for the Dodds
[07:48.63]when they went away on vacation.
[07:51.01]Mr. Dodd hired Margaret to stay in their house
[07:54.10]because he didn't want it left empty.
[07:56.85]M: You mean the Dodds paid Margaret just to live in their house?
[07:59.99]W: It wasn't that easy.
[08:01.86]She had to mow and water the houseplants.
[08:04.78]And when Eric house-sat for Mr. Cohen,
[08:07.81]he had to take care of his pets.
[08:09.85]M: House-sitting sounds like a good job.
[08:12.85]I guess it's a little like baby-sitting
[08:14.30]―except you're taking care of a house instead of children.
[08:17.14]W: The student employment office still has a few jobs posted.
[08:21.23]M: Do I just have to fill out an application?
[08:23.74]W: Margaret and Eric had to interview with the houseowners
[08:27.24]and provide three references each.
[08:30.19]M: That seems like a lot of trouble for a summer job.
[08:32.79]W: The houseowners want some guarantee
[08:35.38]that they can trust the house-sitters.
[08:37.89]You know, they want to make sure you're not the type
[08:41.06]who will throw wild parties in their house,
[08:43.56]or move a group of friends in with you.
[08:46.60]M: House-sitters who do that sort of thing probably aren't paid then.
[08:51.08]W: Usually they are paid anyway just because
[08:53.94]the homeowners don't want to make a fuss.
[08:56.58]But if the homeowner reported it,
[08:59.02]then the house-sitter wouldn't get another job.
[09:01.58]So, why don't you apply?
[09:05.72]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:11.96]8. What does the man want to do this summer?
[09:31.15]9. What did the Dodds do when they went away last summer?
[09:50.45]10. What is one responsibility the house-sitter probably won’t have?
[10:13.10]11. What would happen 
[10:15.25]if a homeowner reported a house-sitter’s bad behaviour?
[10:34.55]Conversation Two
[10:37.04]M: Can you tell me something about the university shuttle bus system?
[10:39.79]This is such a large campus,
[10:41.67]and I have classes all over campus.
[10:44.12]I need to take the shuttle bus from one class to another,
[10:47.36]or I'll never make it on time.
[10:49.51]W: What do you need to know? I think it's a really great system.
[10:53.86]M: First of all, where does it go?
[10:55.52]W: The university shuttle bus system goes all over campus.
[11:00.58]It doesn't leave the campus;
[11:02.93]if you want to travel off-campus,
[11:05.02]you'll need to take the city bus system.
[11:07.85]But the university shuttle bus system will get you
[11:11.40]from one class to the next very efficiently.
[11:14.68]M: And how much does it cost?
[11:16.18]W: It's free, can you believe it?
[11:18.39]So you don't have to pay a cent
[11:21.29]to get all around the university campus.
[11:23.48]M: That's really great. And how do I catch the shuttle bus?
[11:27.03]W: Just look for one of the bright yellow shuttle bus signs,
[11:31.02]and go stand next to it.
[11:33.11]You can see the yellow shuttle bus signs all over campus.
[11:36.76]A shuttle bus will come along approximately every five minutes,
[11:41.34]so you shouldn't have to wait long.
[11:44.17]M: That all sounds good. Thanks for your help.
[11:46.28]W: No problem.
[11:49.44]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[11:55.77]12. What are the man and woman discussing?
[12:15.74]13. What area does the university shuttle bus cover?
[12:36.53]14. How much does the shuttle bus cost?
[12:56.41]15. What color are the shuttle bus signs?
[13:16.36]Section C
[13:17.87]Directions: In this section,
[13:21.16]you will hear three short passages.
[13:22.55]At the end of each passage,
[13:24.70]you will hear some questions.
[13:26.74]Both the passage and the questions
[13:28.73]will be spoken only once.
[13:30.83]After you hear a question,
[13:32.88]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[13:35.52]marked A), B), C) and D).
[13:39.81]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[13:43.35]with a single line through the centre.
[13:46.85]Passage One
[13:48.87]Jet lag, caused by traveling between time zones,
[13:52.02]is becoming a common problem for frequent travelers:
[13:54.85]for 49 percent it is only a nuisance
[13:58.74]and for 45 percent it is a real problem.
[14:02.68]It is caused by disruption to the internal biological clock,
[14:06.69]and may lead to digestive problems, tiredness, and sleep disruption.
[14:12.28]Generally speaking, our biological clock is slightly disturbed
[14:16.92]if we just move into the next time zone,
[14:19.95]but jet lag becomes a problem
[14:22.16]once we have passed through three or four time zones.
[14:25.78]The body takes about one day to get over each hour of time difference.
[14:31.46]But the seriousness of jet lag problems
[14:35.22]also depends on our direction of travel.
[14:38.02]If we travel west we will be in advance of ourselves
[14:43.22]as far as our internal clock is concerned, and problems may arise.
[14:48.34]A west-to-east journey, on the other hand,
[14:51.74]makes us late compared to the local time.
[14:55.09]It often demands even greater effort in adjustment
[14:58.83]since we are not quick enough to catch up with the new time schedule.
[15:03.27]Therefore, a trip from New York to Los Angeles
[15:06.65]often causes fewer problems
[15:09.25]than a Los Angeles-New York trip.
[15:13.14]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:20.61]16. What's the problem a person suffers from
[15:24.26]when traveling between time zones?
[15:42.31]17. How many hours does one need to get over his jet lag problem
[15:47.24]if he travels across three time zones?
[16:07.24]18. What's the main purpose of the passage?
[16:24.64]Passage Two
[16:27.30]A "blogger" is a person who writes
[16:29.03]on an Internet computer website called a "blog".
[16:32.25]The word "blog" is a short way of saying Web log, or personal website.
[16:37.60]Anyone can start a blog, and they can write about anything they like.
[16:42.29]There are millions of blogs on the Internet today.
[16:45.84]They provide news, information and ideas
[16:49.74]to many people who read them.
[16:52.13]They contain links to other websites.
[16:55.27]And they provide a place for people to write their ideas
[16:58.52]and react to the ideas of others.
[17:01.26]A research company called Perseus has studied
[17:04.15]more than 3,000 Web logs.
[17:06.46]It says that blogs are most popular with teenage girls.
[17:10.04]They use them to let their friends know
[17:12.79]what is happening in their lives.
[17:14.64]The study also says that more than 100,000 bloggers
[17:18.38]stopped taking part in the activity after a year.
[17:21.27]However, some people develop serious blogs
[17:23.57]to present political and other ideas.
[17:26.35]At the same time, some long-standing blogs have ended.
[17:30.19]Last week, blogging leader Dave Winer
[17:33.08]closed his free blog service, weblogs.com.
[17:37.18]He says the site became too costly to continue.
[17:40.51]He started the blog four years ago,
[17:42.51]and thousands of people had written on it.
[17:45.66]They are now upset because they did not know that the site was closing.
[17:48.90]One blog that is still going strong is called Rebecca's Pocket.
[17:52.59]Rebecca Blood created the website in 1999.
[17:56.99]She wrote about the history of blogs on the site.
[18:00.34]That article led to a book called The Weblog Handbook.
[18:04.57]It has been translated into four languages so far.
[18:09.62]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:15.36]19. What's a blog?
[18:34.38]20. Why are blogs most popular with teenage girls?
[18:55.12]21. What is true about Rebecca?
[19:14.44]Passage Three
[19:16.44]For three groups of explorers formed
[19:18.64]by college students and young white collars,
[19:21.56]it started out as a wonderful trip.
[19:24.64]They were enjoying themselves exploring the Inner Mongolian desert.
[19:29.83]But when the sandstorm came, the trip became a disaster.
[19:35.47]The drama unfolded during the May Day holiday.
[19:40.02]One girl did not make it before the students were rescued.
[19:44.46]The group was eventually found with the help of a GPS receiver.
[19:49.59]GPS, or global positioning system,
[19:53.43]is a satellite-based navigation system
[19:56.88]made up of a network of 24 satellites.
[20:00.79]It was originally created for military use by the US in 1980s
[20:07.93]but is now available for civilian use.
[20:11.66]GPS works in any weather conditions,
[20:15.40]anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day.
[20:18.94]And the service is free.
[20:21.82]GPS satellites circle the earth twice a day
[20:25.47]and transmit signals and information to the earth.
[20:28.42]GPS receivers take this information
[20:34.81]and calculate the user's exact location.
[20:38.65]A GPS receiver must be locked on
[20:41.33]to the signals of at least three satellites
[20:45.77]to calculate the latitude and longitude of its location.
[20:49.01]With four or more satellites in view,
[20:49.89]the receiver can determine the user's altitude.
[20:53.08]Once the user's position has been determined,
[20:56.73]the GPS receiver can calculate other information,
[21:00.71]such as speed, direction, distance to destination,
[21:05.83]and a whole lot more.
[21:08.98]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[21:15.96]22. What is true about the trip made by the young people?
[21:36.61]23. What is the main topic of the passage?
[21:56.41]24. Which of the following is true about the GPS?
[22:16.71]25. What must be determined first
[22:20.01]before the GPS receiver can calculate other information?
[22:39.35]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
