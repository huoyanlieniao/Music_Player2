[00:15.34]College English Test - Band 4
[00:19.17]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:22.12]Section A
[00:24.08]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.34]you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.23]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.48]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:33.59]Both the news report and the questions
[00:36.42]will be spoken only once.
[00:38.43]After you hear a question,
[00:40.39]you must choose the best answer
[00:42.36]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:46.77]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:50.26]with a single line through the centre.
[00:52.80]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:59.07]A man was arrested on suspicion of attempting to carry explosives 
[01:02.91]through a security checkpoint at an airport, authorities said. 
[01:07.00]Trey Scott Atwater was taken into prison Saturday morning 
[01:10.73]after Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents spotted 
[01:14.64]what they described as a suspicious item. 
[01:17.62]The item was in his carry-on during X-ray screening 
[01:20.63]at a security checkpoint at the airport, 
[01:22.71]an FBI spokesman said in a statement. 
[01:26.05]Neither the FBI nor the TSA identified the explosives, 
[01:29.38]though an airport spokeswoman said 
[01:31.92]the items were “wrapped in military grade wrapping” 
[01:34.78]and are in the possession of the police. 
[01:37.67]At no time was there any danger to the people at the airport. 
[01:41.22]The airport terminal was temporarily closed 
[01:44.56]while authorities “conducted a sweep, 
[01:46.90]and deemed all clear,” 
[01:48.47]said a city spokeswoman. 
[01:50.19]Atwater has been arrested on a federal count 
[01:52.74]of attempting to get on an aircraft with an explosive.
[01:57.92]1. Who found the suspicious item at the airport?
[02:17.89]2. What do we learn about the airport from the news report?
[02:38.43]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:45.59]The Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, 
[02:48.83]the government agency that regulates civil aviation in the United States, 
[02:53.37]announced new rules this month to combat pilot fatigue. 
[02:58.56]The new guidelines, 
[03:00.00]which will go into effect in two years, 
[03:02.80]call for reducing the number of pilots’ on-duty hours 
[03:06.70]and giving them a 10-hour rest period between shifts, 
[03:10.78]so they can get at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep. 
[03:15.13]The new rules apply to only pilots of passenger airlines. 
[03:20.07]FAA determined that including pilots who fly cargo planes
[03:24.71]---a large segment of the aviation industry---
[03:28.28]would add too much to the cost of implementing the changes. 
[03:32.54]But the Independent Pilots Association (IPA) has filed a lawsuit 
[03:37.77]asking the government to set one level of safety for all pilots.
[03:45.31]3. What is the main purpose of the new rules?
[04:04.86]4. Why was IPA unhappy about the new rules?
[04:24.84]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:29.98]The Authors Guild, 
[04:30.97]a writing association, 
[04:32.18]has started the new year successfully. 
[04:34.92]First, the group, which represents the interests of writers, 
[04:38.38]asked the Supreme Court to review an October appeals court ruling, 
[04:42.54]which supported Google's right to digitize out-of-print books 
[04:46.53]without an author's permission. 
[04:48.87]A few days later, 
[04:50.12]the association raised another issue 
[04:52.46]when it released a letter to publishers 
[04:54.51]demanding better contract terms for authors.
[04:57.22]Both moves come as many writers find it harder and harder 
[05:01.45]to make a living from their writing. 
[05:03.55]Since 2009, 
[05:04.80]the mean income for writers has gone down 30 percent, 
[05:08.63]says the association’s executive director, 
[05:11.18]Mary Rasenberger.
[05:12.56]“It’s alarming. 
[05:14.33]Incomes are now down to unsustainable levels, 
[05:17.17]and that means that even the authors, 
[05:19.72]who have been writing for decades, 
[05:21.37]are now being forced to seek other work,” she says. 
[05:24.74]“So, we are looking at this in a comprehensive way: 
[05:27.80]Why this happening, 
[05:29.59]and what can we do about it?”
[05:31.28]Rasenberger says 
[05:32.68]the Google Books case raised the issue of copyright protection. 
[05:36.37]Among other things, the association says 
[05:39.31]its writers should get a higher percentage of e-book income 
[05:42.36]and authors should also be able to retain the rights to their own books.
[05:48.94]5. What did the Authors Guild do in the new year?
[06:09.03]6. Why did the Authors Guild take the two moves in the new year?
[06:30.93]7. What issue is the Google Book case concern with?
[06:52.14]Section B
[06:53.69]Directions: In this section,
[06:56.31]you will hear two long conversations.
[06:58.55]At the end of each conversation,
[07:00.46]you will hear four questions.
[07:02.60]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:05.11]will be spoken only once.
[07:07.20]After you hear a question,
[07:08.95]you must choose the best answer
[07:10.74]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:16.04]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:19.57]with a single line through the centre.
[07:22.90]Conversation One
[07:25.33]W: Hello?
[07:26.63]M: Hi, Sue. It's Bill Parker from your calculus class.
[07:29.92]W: Oh sure. How are you?
[07:32.18]M: Fine, thanks. Listen, I'm working on our assignment
[07:36.17]and I can't seem to figure out the last problem and,
[07:39.17]uh... the teaching assistant's out of town,
[07:41.71]so I was wondering if you could help me.
[07:43.80]W: Well, I did the last one, but I'm not sure it's right.
[07:47.76]M: At least you finally figured it out
[07:49.96]―I didn't get past the first three steps.
[07:52.50]Would you like to have coffee with me?
[07:54.79]We could go over all of the problems.
[07:57.08]W: That's a good idea-I need help with number five.
[08:00.58]I'm completely lost on that one.
[08:03.21]M: Are you free now?
[08:04.32]W: I have swimming practice in a few minutes
[08:07.31]and then I have to study for a biology exam
[08:10.62]―but I could meet you right after dinner.
[08:13.55]M: Uh, that's bad for me
[08:15.36]―I have a meeting for The Signal.
[08:16.90]W: The what?
[08:17.85]M: The Signal―you know, the campus literary magazine.
[08:20.95]It comes out once a month.
[08:22.73]W: Oh, sorry―I just transferred here this year.
[08:26.37]M: I'll give you a copy.
[08:27.77]In fact, I'll bring it when we meet...
[08:29.88]So, anyway, what about tomorrow... After lunch, maybe?
[08:33.42]W: Great. See you around one.
[08:38.65]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[08:44.94]8. How do the speakers know each other?
[09:04.31]9. Why isn’t the woman available in a few minutes?
[09:24.12]10. What can be inferred about the campus literary magazine?
[09:44.46]11. What is Bill going to do after dinner? 
[10:03.87]Conversation Two
[10:06.77]M: Is that a map? Are you going sailing or something?
[10:09.18]W: I wish. It's a hurricane-tracking chart.
[10:12.77]It's a map of tropical ocean areas southeast of us.
[10:16.61]It follows the development of tropical storms, even hurricanes.
[10:20.68]They develop and move around the Atlantic in Caribbean
[10:24.48]and here on Florida coast.
[10:26.50]We get hit a lot by those in July or August, at least winds or rain.
[10:31.58]M: Do you think that the tropical storm is on the way?
[10:34.13]W: Too early to tell, but we need to be prepared.
[10:37.33]The radio mentioned possible evacuation routes.
[10:40.90]M: Really? It's that serious?
[10:42.74]W: You'd better believe it.
[10:44.28]Late summer is hurricane season.
[10:46.69]The television updates locations and speeds every hour.
[10:50.07]M: What did they say is out there now?
[10:52.07]W: A couple of tropical depressions,
[10:54.47]two storms and two hurricanes.
[10:56.34]M: What's the difference?
[10:57.97]W: Wind velocity. A depression is least serious actually,
[11:02.91]and a hurricane is the most serious.
[11:05.11]M: How serious are the winds in hurricanes?
[11:07.44]W: They have sustained winds of 74 miles per hour and up.
[11:11.98]M: What are the names on the map?
[11:14.23]David, Arlene, Francisco, and Gina.
[11:16.77]W: You know weather forecasters give the hurricanes
[11:19.62]the names of people to make storms easy to identify.
[11:23.27]M: I wonder what the status of the storm is now.
[11:26.26]W: You shall turn on the television, and it has the best coverage.
[11:30.26]There is an up-date coming up in five minutes.
[11:36.05]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[11:43.42]12. What is the conversation mainly about?
[12:03.41]13. Which is true about a depression, 
[12:07.79]a storm and a hurricane?
[12:25.26]14. Why are hurricanes named after people?
[12:45.15]15. What are the man and woman going to do next?
[13:05.84]Section C
[13:07.30]Directions: In this section,
[13:10.60]you will hear three short passages.
[13:12.55]At the end of each passage,
[13:14.18]you will hear some questions.
[13:15.94]Both the passage and the questions
[13:18.04]will be spoken only once.
[13:20.18]After you hear a question,
[13:22.08]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[13:25.03]marked A), B), C) and D).
[13:29.26]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[13:32.65]with a single line through the centre.
[13:36.65]Passage One
[13:39.40]In the world of business, it is not always easy for women
[13:42.84]to do the same things as men. Consider the working dinner.
[13:48.31]In order to do your job well,
[13:50.71]it's important to sometimes see clients
[13:53.06]and business contacts away from the office.
[13:55.86]In a more relaxed atmosphere,
[13:58.36]you can get to know your business partner better.
[14:01.40]In the end, after all, people do business with people they like.
[14:06.44]Women start out at a disadvantage
[14:10.09]because it's tough to invite men out for a game of golf or tennis.
[14:14.58]Men usually prefer to play sports with other men.
[14:19.12]You might think that restaurants are the perfect playing field.
[14:23.51]But they can be dangerous ground.
[14:26.61]If people from the office see two men they know
[14:29.73]having dinner together,
[14:30.83]they think it's business.
[14:32.77]If colleagues see a woman dining with a man,
[14:35.73]they often wonder if it's another kind of business.
[14:39.82]One answer is to take another colleague or client to dinner.
[14:45.46]Of course, this isn't always convenient.
[14:49.59]So when I can't do this, I take guys out to dinner one-to-one
[14:53.58]―to places where I'm most likely to see colleagues.
[14:56.98]The more your colleagues see you having working dinners
[15:00.07]with different men,
[15:01.62]the more they know it is part of your business style.
[15:05.37]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:11.76]16. According to the passage,
[15:14.49]why do people like to see clients away from the office?
[15:33.78]17. When people see from their office two men having dinner,
[15:38.10]what do they think?
[15:54.97]18. Why does the author dine with male-clients in places
[15:59.42]likely to be seen by her colleagues?
[16:17.17]Passage Two
[16:19.75]England is not a big country:
[16:21.67]from north to south and from east to west
[16:24.80]it is only about three hundred miles across.
[16:28.19]But for a small country it has a surprisingly wide range of climates.
[16:33.09]People who have never visited England
[16:35.37]or who have visited only part of it often make the mistake
[16:39.02]that it is a very cold and wet country.
[16:42.26]Except for the summer months of June to September,
[16:45.74]this is probably true of the north of England and the Midlands.
[16:50.29]In the south, however, the climate is much more pleasant.
[16:54.79]One result is that when people retire from their work in the north,
[16:59.06]they often prefer to move down to the south.
[17:02.67]Perhaps the warmest part of the country is the southwest,
[17:06.86]which consists of the counties of Devon and Cornwall,
[17:09.94]where palm trees, bamboo and many semitropical plants grow well.
[17:16.35]Flowers and vegetables ripen
[17:17.90]as much as a month earlier than those elsewhere.
[17:21.58]Farmers in the areas gain a higher price for their vegetables and flowers
[17:25.91]because they are ready earlier.
[17:28.04]In winter there may be several feet of snow in other parts of England
[17:31.83]but there will probably be no snow at all in the southwest.
[17:36.87]This may be one of the reasons
[17:38.73]why the southwest is one of England's most popular holiday areas.
[17:44.06]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:49.40]19. What's the distance from the centre of England to the south coast?
[18:11.08]20. What is said about the climate of England?
[18:30.90]21. Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?
[18:53.01]Passage Three
[18:55.59]London taxi drivers know the capital like the back of their hands.
[19:00.47]No matter how small and indistinct the street is,
[19:04.56]the driver will be able to get you there without any trouble.
[19:08.75]The reason London taxi drivers are so efficient is that
[19:13.29]they have all gone through a very tough training period
[19:16.93]to get a special taxi driving license.
[19:19.67]During this period, which can take from two to four years,
[19:24.41]the would-be taxi driver has to learn the most direct route
[19:28.30]to every single road and to every important building in London.
[19:33.43]To achieve this, most learners go around the city on small motorbikes,
[19:38.77]practicing how to move to and from different points of the city.
[19:44.07]Learner taxi drivers are tested several times
[19:46.96]during their training period by government officers.
[19:50.60]Their exams are a terrible experience.
[19:54.36]The officers ask you,
[19:56.11]"How do you get from Buckingham Palace
[19:58.75]to the Tower of London?"
[20:00.79]And you have to take them there in a direct line.
[20:03.62]When you get to the tower, they won't say "Well done";
[20:07.62]they will quickly move on to the next question.
[20:11.21]After five or six questions
[20:13.32]they will just say "see you in two months' time"
[20:16.71]and then you know the exam is over.
[20:19.96]Learner drivers are not allowed to work
[20:22.15]and earn money as drivers.
[20:24.58]Therefore, many of them keep their previous jobs
[20:27.83]until they have obtained their license.
[20:30.55]The training can cost quite a lot
[20:32.87]because learners have to pay for their own expenses
[20:36.09]on the tests and a medical exam.
[20:41.34]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:46.92]22. Why are London taxi drivers very efficient?
[21:08.03]23. How long does the training period last?
[21:27.71]24. Why does the speaker think the driving test is a terrible experience?
[21:49.01]25. Why do learner drivers have to keep their present jobs?
[22:09.14]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[22:11.49]
