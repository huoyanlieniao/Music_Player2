[00:15.34]College English Test - Band 4
[00:19.41]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:23.28]Section A
[00:25.27]Directions: In this section,
[00:29.20]you will hear three news reports.
[00:32.15]At the end of each news report,
[00:34.71]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:37.98]Both the news report and the questions
[00:41.42]will be spoken only once.
[00:43.91]After you hear a question,
[00:46.00]you must choose the best answer
[00:48.64]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:54.56]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:58.85]with a single line through the centre.
[01:02.04]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[01:08.69]Pupils in the poorest countries are suffering 
[01:12.97]from a lack of basic textbooks, 
[01:15.26]according to a report from a United Nations agency. 
[01:19.64]The study from UNESCO gives examples 
[01:23.03]such as reading books in Cameroon being shared 
[01:26.47]between 12 students. 
[01:28.51]The report is calling for a more centralised buying system 
[01:32.49]which would make them more affordable. 
[01:35.03]Report director Aaron Benavot says 
[01:38.87]textbooks are an important way of raising standards in school. 
[01:42.81]“Next to a good teacher, 
[01:45.06]well-designed textbooks in sufficient quantities 
[01:48.25]are the most effective way to improve students' learning.”
[01:52.46]The report suggests the process of distributing textbooks 
[01:56.48]should be approached in the same systematic way 
[02:00.07]as public health programmes. 
[02:02.56]“a new system must be set up 
[02:04.74]so that textbooks can move cheaply and effectively 
[02:08.63]from a printing house to school and into the hands of children." 
[02:13.26]says Mr Benavot.
[02:16.10]1. What do we learn about the pupils in poorest countries 
[02:20.87]from the news report?
[02:37.03]2. What should people do to help these children?
[02:56.58]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[03:04.77]Friends Reunited
[03:06.44]---one of the UK’s first social networks---
[03:08.94]has announced it will soon close. 
[03:10.98]One of its founders Steve Pankhurst explained in an email 
[03:14.99]that the platform was still used by “a handful of members” 
[03:19.05]but that it was “no longer used for the purpose it was built for”.
[03:23.18]Friends Reunited launched in the year 2000   
[03:26.31]and was bought by broadcaster ITV for ￡175m in 2005. 
[03:32.53]However, 
[03:33.53]it failed to keep pace with other social networks. 
[03:36.52]It was sold to comic publisher DC Thomson for only ￡25m in 2009 
[03:43.63]and Mr Pankhurst wrote in a blog post 
[03:45.93]that the company had offered it back to him a couple of years ago. 
[03:49.55]Pankhurst and business partner Jason Porter agreed 
[03:53.25]to take on the site for a trial period to see if they could refresh it. 
[03:57.83]"It became clear that most of the actual users coming to the site 
[04:01.93]were using it purely as a message board,” 
[04:04.70]wrote Mr. Pankhurst.
[04:07.49]3. What is the news report mainly about?
[04:27.01]4. What do we learn about Friends Reunited from the news report?
[04:48.23]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:54.34]Attacks by terrorists have led to a dramatic fall in tourism 
[04:59.47]in parts of North Africa, 
[05:01.80]where millions rely on the trade to make a living. 
[05:05.59]New figures 
[05:07.03]from the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) 
[05:12.55]show that visits to North Africa fell by 8% this year, 
[05:17.88]resisting a global upward trend. 
[05:20.86]International tourism grew by 4.4% overall, 
[05:25.75]to reach a total of 1.18 billion arrivals, 
[05:29.69]according to the UNWTO.
[05:32.62]But countries such as Tunisia, 
[05:35.21]Egypt and Morocco have been hit hard. 
[05:38.85]Beach resorts such as Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, 
[05:43.55]where a passenger jet was loaded with a bomb in November, 
[05:46.95]and Sousse in Tunisia, 
[05:49.23]where gunmen opened fire at holidaymakers in June, 
[05:52.58]have seen visitor numbers sharply decline. 
[05:55.90]Some 3,500 British tourists left Tunisia in the days 
[06:01.52]after the Sousse attack, 
[06:03.80]in which 38 people---30 of them British---
[06:06.79]were shot by Islamist gunman at the Port El Kantaoui resort. 
[06:12.86]Limited data available for Africa as a whole suggested 
[06:16.94]that tourism was down by 3% to 53 million
[06:21.83]---8% in North Africa and 1% in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
[06:27.24]But citing a “larger degree of uncertainty and unpredictability”, 
[06:32.52]the UNWTO has predicted between 3.5% and 4.5% of growth 
[06:40.58]in global tourism in the next year.
[06:43.17]5. What change took place in North Africa?
[07:04.30]6. What helped bring about the change?
[07:23.27]7. What is the trend of World Tourism?
[07:42.38]Section B
[07:43.63]Directions: In this section,
[07:47.62]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:50.99]At the end of each conversation,
[07:53.63]you will hear four questions.
[07:56.27]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:59.30]will be spoken only once.
[08:02.46]After you hear a question,
[08:04.59]you must choose the best answer
[08:06.43]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[08:12.33]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[08:16.76]with a single line through the centre.
[08:20.69]Conversation One
[08:24.12]M: Excuse me, is this the ad department?
[08:26.78]W: Sure is. Can I help you?
[08:28.67]M: Hi, I'm M Benson... er...
[08:32.11]I've got a few questions.
[08:34.05]I'd like to know more
[08:34.93]about how to advertise in your newspaper.
[08:37.68]W: OK. Well, first,
[08:39.12]have you seen our rate card?
[08:40.96]M: Rate card?
[08:42.06]I'm afraid I don't know anything about it.
[08:44.44]W: No problem.
[08:45.69]We'll take it from the top.
[08:47.53]Here. This is a rate card.
[08:49.78]It's a little complicated at first,
[08:52.42]but it shows you how much various types of ads in our newspaper cost.
[08:56.54]M: Gee, I don't know where to start.
[08:59.08]W: There are two basics you have to consider.
[09:02.31]One, how big do you want your ad to be?
[09:05.76]The larger your ad is,
[09:07.34]the more it costs...
[09:08.58]and the more people will notice it.
[09:10.93]M: Great, so far. ...
[09:12.08]Please continue.
[09:13.97]W: Second, how often do you want it to be in the paper?
[09:17.25]Of course, the more frequent your ad is,
[09:19.84]the more it costs.
[09:21.42]M: Yes. I understand.
[09:23.57]But I have no idea what kind I should choose.
[09:27.51]W: There's a rate for running an ad one time,
[09:30.93]various rates for multiple ads,
[09:33.37]and additional rates for weekend ads.
[09:36.27]Weekend ads are more expensive
[09:38.12]―more people read the paper then
[09:40.01]and they take longer to look at ads on weekends.
[09:43.20]May I ask for what you want to advertise?
[09:46.09]M: It's for my wife.
[09:47.52]She's starting an antique shop.
[09:49.77]Can you give me some suggestions?
[09:52.60]W: I can help you work out a program
[09:54.80]for your wife's new business.
[09:56.59]M: When do you recommend we run the ads?
[09:59.43]W: If you know who your customers are going to be,
[10:02.70]we can really help you.
[10:04.59]For instance, we know what parts of the newspaper
[10:07.55]are more likely to be read by women...
[10:09.88]and we know on what days they read it.
[10:12.46]M: Amazing. I will ask my wife.
[10:15.60]She knows a lot more about that than I do.
[10:17.99]I will come back to you for help tomorrow.
[10:22.23]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:30.00]8. What is the conversation mainly about?
[10:49.46]9. What is not true about the rate of advertising on newspaper?
[11:09.62]10. Why is advertisement on weekends more expensive?
[11:30.08]11. What does the woman suggest the man do 
[11:34.51]before running the ads?
[11:52.38]Conversation Two
[11:55.05]W: Good morning, Dr. Smith.
[11:56.75]I'm not sure whether you can help me or not,
[11:59.04]but I'm getting desperate!
[12:00.54]M: Oh, what's wrong?
[12:02.33]What is making you so desperate?
[12:04.37]W: Well, everybody laughs at me because I'm so fat.
[12:07.20]I've always been overweight.
[12:09.64]I'm trying to eat less but I don't seem to be able to lose any weight.
[12:13.59]I don't know what I can do.
[12:15.69]Maybe you can give me some medication?
[12:18.77]M: Well, it is not a good idea to eat less.
[12:22.39]You should eat more healthy food like fruits and vegetables,
[12:26.27]and avoid fast foods like the hamburgers and hot dogs.
[12:29.67]W: But hamburgers and hot dogs are my favorite.
[12:32.90]M: That's the problem.
[12:34.41]They contain high calorie that causes fatness.
[12:38.34]In addition to avoiding these high calorie foods,
[12:40.78]you should do some exercises.
[12:42.86]Physical exercise does a lot of good to health
[12:45.75]and will be an effective way to reduce weight.
[12:48.89]Medicine is not always the best solution to your problem.
[12:52.62]W: I know, but I don't have time to do exercise.
[12:56.61]You know, I'm busy at my work from morning to night.
[12:59.65]Besides, I am not rich enough to go to the gym.
[13:02.67]M: You needn't spend much time on exercise
[13:05.91]and you don't have to go to the gym.
[13:08.71]I suggest that you walk more regularly.
[13:11.54]You could get off the bus one stop early and walk the last bit.
[13:15.88]When you walk, try to walk a little more quickly.
[13:19.36]You could also use the stairs instead of the elevator.
[13:22.95]W: That's really a good idea.
[13:24.69]M: You will succeed,
[13:26.48]if you act in accordance with my suggestions.
[13:30.36]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[13:38.62]12. What are they talking about?
[13:58.06]13. Why does the woman feel desperate?
[14:16.83]14. What is not the man’s suggestion?
[14:37.88]15. What does the man suggest the woman do about exercise?
[14:58.61]Section C
[15:00.99]Directions: In this section,
[15:04.70]you will hear three short passages.
[15:07.15]At the end of each passage,
[15:09.49]you will hear some questions.
[15:11.58]Both the passage and the questions
[15:14.57]will be spoken only once.
[15:17.64]After you hear a question,
[15:19.99]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[15:23.48]marked A), B), C) and D).
[15:28.44]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[15:32.43]with a single line through the centre.
[15:37.11]Passage One
[15:39.05]Sam had worked 30 years for the same company
[15:42.83]and now he had to retire.
[15:45.57]As a sign of gratitude,
[15:48.11]the company held a dinner in his honor.
[15:50.65]"Sam," announced his boss,
[15:53.63]"It is my great honor to present this gift to you
[15:58.26]on behalf of the company."
[16:00.21]Sam walked down to the front of the table
[16:03.80]and accepted the gift with pride.
[16:06.43]It was a gold watch and on it was written
[16:10.26]"To faithful Sam for 30 years of Service."
[16:14.25]Sam wept, "I am at a loss for words."
[16:19.52]At home, Sam's wife looked at the gold watch critically.
[16:24.10] "For this you worked 30 years?
[16:27.53]A cheap gold-plated watch?"
[16:30.92]"It's the thought,
[16:32.50]dear," answered Sam.
[16:34.15]"The important thing is that I am not working any more."
[16:38.78]His wife held the gold watch to her ear and said:
[16:42.57]"Neither is your watch."
[16:45.01]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:53.07]16. What did the company do to honor Sam?
[17:12.88]17. How did Sam feel when he saw
[17:16.91]what was written on the watch?
[17:33.29]18. What can we infer from the story?
[17:54.29]Passage Two
[17:56.68]Religious and private schools receive little or no support
[18:01.46]from public taxes in the United States.
[18:04.44]As a result, they are more expensive to attend.
[18:08.82]The religious schools in America
[18:11.30]are usually run by churches.
[18:13.70]Therefore they tend to be less expensive
[18:17.23]than private schools.
[18:19.27]When there is free education available
[18:22.01]to all children in the United States,
[18:24.04]why do people spend money on private schools?
[18:27.29]Americans offer a great variety of reasons for doing so.
[18:32.61]Some parents send their children to private schools
[18:35.95]because the classes there are usually smaller.
[18:39.93]In their opinion,
[18:41.52]the public schools in their area
[18:43.66]are not of high enough quality to meet their needs.
[18:47.39]Private schools in the United States
[18:49.93]range widely in size and quality,
[18:53.56]and they offer all kinds of programs
[18:56.25]to meet the needs of certain students.
[19:00.38]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:07.00]19. Why is it usually expensive
[19:11.33]to attend religious and private schools?
[19:29.42]20. What is one of the reasons for people
[19:32.95]to send their children to private schools?
[19:51.04]21. Who usually runs religious schools in the United States?
[20:11.97]Passage Three
[20:14.51]An elderly woman yesterday made a legal claim
[20:17.74]against a department store
[20:19.49]because it had wrongly accused her of stealing a Christmas card.
[20:24.21]Mrs. Doss White, 72 years old,
[20:28.54]is claiming $3,000 damages from the store
[20:33.12]for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment.
[20:36.22]Mrs. White visited the store
[20:39.30]while doing Christmas shopping,
[20:41.49]but did not buy anything.
[20:44.13]She was followed through the town by a store manager.
[20:47.81]He had been told that a customer saw her take a card
[20:51.94]and put it in her shopping bag.
[20:54.78]He stopped her at a bookstore as she was reading a book.
[20:59.11]Mrs. White said, "This man, a total stranger,
[21:03.74]suddenly grasped my bag and asked if he could look in it."
[21:08.42]She was taken back to the store
[21:11.25]and shut in a small room in full view of shoppers for 20 minutes
[21:16.33]until the police arrived.
[21:18.47]At the police station she was body-searched and nothing was found.
[21:23.30] Her lawyer said that the department store sent an insincere apology
[21:28.72]and they insisted that she may have been stealing.
[21:32.50]The hearing continues today.
[21:36.09]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[21:42.56]22. What does the story tell us about the old woman?
[22:02.91]23. What was said to have been stolen?
[22:21.61]24. What happened to Mrs. White
[22:24.82]after she was taken back to the store?
[22:42.90]25. What was now the attitude
[22:46.33]of the department store in this legal case?
[23:04.97]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[23:08.01]
