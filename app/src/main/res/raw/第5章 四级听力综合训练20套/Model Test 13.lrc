[00:15.34]College English Test - Band 4
[00:19.96]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:23.26]Section A
[00:25.32]Directions: In this section,
[00:29.31]you will hear three news reports.
[00:32.00]At the end of each news report,
[00:34.75]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:38.08]Both the news report and the questions
[00:41.28]will be spoken only once.
[00:43.84]After you hear a question,
[00:45.94]you must choose the best answer
[00:48.45]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:54.29]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:58.93]with a single line through the centre.
[01:02.54]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[01:07.46]The US president has said the time has come 
[01:11.11]for a review on the US immigration system. 
[01:14.91]He made his case at a high school in Las Vegas, 
[01:18.59]Nevada, 
[01:19.43]a day after a group of senators outlined a framework for reform. 
[01:24.97]The White House and senators devise a path to citizenship 
[01:28.75]for many of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants 
[01:33.75]in the US. 
[01:35.43]He noted that the current system was “out of date 
[01:38.67]and badly broken”. 
[01:40.82]The president’s case for an immigration reform 
[01:44.07]reflects a plan he rolled out three years ago, 
[01:47.91]though that did not go far. 
[01:49.95]The president now backs the Senate plan 
[01:52.78]including making illegal immigrants pay taxes and fines, 
[01:56.95]and sending them to the back of the queue 
[01:59.85]before they can become American citizens. 
[02:03.44]After eight years, 
[02:05.10]individuals would be allowed to become legal permanent residents 
[02:09.40]and would eventually become citizens five years later, 
[02:13.20]according to his scheme three years ago.
[02:18.66]1. What do we learn about the immigration reform 
[02:22.70]from the news report?
[02:38.98]2. How long would it take for illegal immigrants to gain citizenship?
[03:00.51]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[03:08.96]Digital textbooks are transforming the way many students learn. 
[03:12.99]All the Fairfax County Public Schools 
[03:15.79]have begun using online course material 
[03:18.44]for their middle- and high-school students. 
[03:21.09]This school year, 
[03:22.39]the schools shifted from hard cover to electronic textbooks 
[03:26.27]for social studies in its middle and high schools. 
[03:29.26]The switch came after digital books were used in 15 schools last year. 
[03:34.65]“Our students come to us technologically 
[03:37.61]ready to use resources from a variety of different places,” 
[03:41.25]says Assistant Superintendent Peter Noonan. 
[03:44.39]“There’s a significant financial benefit as well. 
[03:46.89]Usually it is between 50 dollars and 70 dollars to buy a textbook for each student,” 
[03:52.59]Noonan says, 
[03:53.55]“which adds up to roughly 8 million dollars for all of our students. 
[03:57.59]We actually have purchased all of the online textbooks 
[04:00.84]for our students for just under 6 million dollars.”
[04:06.47]3. What happened to the schools in Fairfax County this school year?
[04:27.72]4. How much have schools saved with digital textbooks?
[04:48.13]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:56.00]Authorities say everyone has been transferred from a luxury hotel in Dubai 
[05:01.03]that was still burning early Friday. 
[05:03.93]The city’s police chief says all residents were out of the 63-story hotel, 
[05:09.91]known as "The Address.” 
[05:12.26]The hotel had been packed with people celebrating New Year’s Eve 
[05:16.45]when fire broke out at about 9:30 p.m. 
[05:20.29]At least 14 people were injured. 
[05:23.77]The hotel stands across from the world’s tallest skyscraper, 
[05:28.12]the Burj Khalifa. 
[05:30.06]The Burj Khalifa is more than 800 meters tall. 
[05:33.91]It is the center of spectacular fireworks 
[05:36.96]along the Dubai water front for New Year's. 
[05:39.90]Fireworks went on as planned. 
[05:42.64]Flames quickly moved through more than 20 stories of the hotel. 
[05:47.09]It could be seen for kilometers in all directions. 
[05:51.26]Within 30 minutes, 
[05:53.21]flames raced to the top of the hotel tower, 
[05:56.02]and the sky was full of thick black smoke. 
[05:58.95]Burning pieces of the hotel fell to the ground from the tower. 
[06:03.50]Witnesses said tens of thousands of people were crowded 
[06:08.13]into the downtown area near the burning hotel and the Burj Khalifa. 
[06:13.67]Authorities in the United Arab Emirates said earlier Thursday 
[06:17.85]that thousands of security personnel were on duty 
[06:21.59]because of the New Year’s events.
[06:26.19]5. What is the news report mainly about?
[06:45.42]6. What do we learn about the fire from the news report?
[07:04.90]7. What do we learn from the witnesses’ remark?
[07:24.44]Section B
[07:26.19]Directions: In this section,
[07:29.27]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:32.42]At the end of each conversation,
[07:35.35]you will hear four questions.
[07:37.95]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:41.63]will be spoken only once.
[07:43.92]After you hear a question,
[07:45.87]you must choose the best answer
[07:48.51]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:53.96]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:59.13]with a single line through the centre.
[08:02.66]Conversation One
[08:07.21]W: Hey, Taxi! Ah, great. Thanks for pulling over.
[08:10.11]M: Where to?
[08:11.91]W: Well, I'm going to the National Museum of Art, and...
[08:15.51]M: Hop in. No problem. Hang on!
[08:17.81]W: Uh. Excuse me. How long does it take to get there?
[08:22.49]M: Well, that all depends on the traffic,
[08:25.65]but it shouldn't take more than twenty minutes for the average driver.
[08:30.10]W: Oh.
[08:31.89]M: And I'm not average. I have driving down to an art,
[08:35.58]so we should be able to cruise through traffic
[08:37.97]and get there in less than twenty minutes.
[08:40.90]W: Okay. Uh, sorry for asking…
[08:43.51]M: Yeah?
[08:44.31]W: But do you have any idea of how much the fare will be?
[08:47.81]M: Oh, it shouldn't be more than 18 dollars...
[08:51.84]not including a... uh-hum... a tip of course.
[08:56.72]W: Oh, and by the way,
[08:59.95]do you know what time the museum closes?
[09:02.45]M: Well, I would guess around 6 o'clock.
[09:06.04]W: Uh, do you have the time?
[09:07.84]M: Yeah. It's half past four.
[09:10.38]W: Thanks.
[09:11.18]M: Uh, is this your first time to the city, right?
[09:13.87]W: Yeah. How did you know?
[09:16.11]M: Well, you can tell tourists from a mile away in this city
[09:20.24]because they walk down the street looking straight up at the skyscrapers.
[09:24.63]W: Oh, before I forget,
[09:27.07]can you recommend any good restaurants downtown
[09:30.42]that offer meals at a reasonable price?
[09:32.82]M: Umm... Well, the Mexican restaurant, La Fajita, is fantastic.
[09:39.92]It's not as inexpensive as other places I know,
[09:43.21]but the decor is very authentic,
[09:45.71]and the portions are larger than most places I've been to.
[09:49.26]W: Sounds great! How do I get there from the museum?
[09:52.45]M: Well, you can catch the subway right outside the museum.
[09:56.43]There are buses that run that way,
[09:59.31]but you would have to transfer a couple of times.
[10:01.97]And there are taxis too, but they don't run by the museum that often.
[10:07.96]W: Okay. Thanks.
[10:12.59]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:19.56]8. Where is the woman going? 
[10:37.91]9. How long will it take to get to the woman’s destination? 
[10:57.90]10. How does the man comment on the Mexican restaurant 
[11:02.04]he recommends?
[11:18.93]11. Which seems to be the most convenient way to the restaurant? 
[11:39.18]Conversation Two
[11:42.15]M: Hello! You seem worried. Can I help you?
[11:44.80]W: Oh, I feel so strange with my feet in the skis (滑雪屐).
[11:49.23]M: So you don't know how to ski.
[11:51.48]Is it the first time you come here skiing?
[11:54.42]W: It's even the first time I have seen the real white snow.
[11:58.54]M: No kidding! Where are you from, young lady?
[12:00.99]W: My family and I live in Hainan Province, China.
[12:05.47]We do not have snow in winter. It's always sunshine.
[12:08.96]M: No wonder. I guess you must be a good swimmer, then.
[12:12.76]W: You're right. Swimming is my favourite hobby.
[12:15.60]But I simply don't know what to do with these skis.
[12:19.77]M: Don't worry. I'm sure you will learn it very soon.
[12:22.92]Now walk as I do, all right?... Good!
[12:26.47]Let's go up the hill and try once, shall we?
[12:28.96]When you want to go up the slope,
[12:30.91]you should stand sideways and go up step by step,
[12:33.99]just like a crab!
[12:35.33]W: Oh, it's really funny.
[12:37.58]I've never walked in this way, but it's interesting.
[12:40.80]M: Let's move to the gentle slope, shall we?
[12:44.05]It will make things easier.
[12:45.70]W: I guess I'm a little nervous.
[12:47.69]M: Take it easy. Trust yourself.
[12:50.10]Now, keep leaning forward while going down.
[12:53.03]Remember the tips mustn't cross or you'll fall down.
[12:57.17]If you want to stop, you should point the tips together, got it?
[13:00.93]W: I see. Oh, I have done it! Thank you. You are so kind!
[13:08.55]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[13:16.83]12. Why does the woman seem worried?
[13:36.32]13. What is the woman’s favourite hobby?
[13:56.01]14. Where did the man lead the woman first 
[14:00.58]in order to make things easier?
[14:18.31]15. If the woman wants to stop, 
[14:22.12]what should she do?
[14:39.24]Section C
[14:40.42]Directions: In this section,
[14:44.32]you will hear three short passages.
[14:46.66]At the end of each passage,
[14:49.11]you will hear some questions.
[14:51.15]Both the passage and the questions
[14:54.23]will be spoken only once.
[14:56.87]After you hear a question,
[14:59.37]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[15:03.51]marked A), B), C) and D).
[15:07.64]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[15:12.09]with a single line through the centre.
[15:15.23]Passage One
[15:18.92]One hundred and thirteen million Americans
[15:21.46]have at least one bank-issued credit card.
[15:24.76]They give their owners automatic credit in stores, restaurants,
[15:29.40]and hotels at home, across the country, and even abroad,
[15:34.19]and they make banking services available as well.
[15:37.91]More and more of these credit cards can be read automatically,
[15:42.39]making it possible to withdraw or deposit money in scattered locations,
[15:47.48]whether or not the local branch bank is open.
[15:52.43]For many of us the "cashless society" is not on the horizon
[15:58.02]―it's already here.
[15:59.74]While computers offer these conveniences to consumers,
[16:04.24]they have many advantages for sellers too.
[16:07.26]Electronic cash registers can do much more than simply ring up sales.
[16:12.71]They can keep a wide range of records,
[16:15.60]including who sold what, when, and to whom.
[16:20.32]This information allows businessmen
[16:22.77]to keep track of their list of goods
[16:25.06]by showing which items are being sold
[16:27.45]and how fast they are moving.
[16:30.05]At the same time these computers record
[16:33.10]which hours are busiest
[16:34.40]and which employees are the most efficient,
[16:37.09]allowing personnel and staffing assignments to be made accordingly.
[16:42.04]And they also identify preferred customer for promotional campaigns.
[16:47.28]Numerous other commercial enterprises,
[16:50.12]from theaters to magazine publishers,
[16:53.22]from gas and electric utilities to milk processors,
[16:57.22]bring better and more efficient services
[17:00.00]to consumers through the use of computers.
[17:04.26]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:10.77]16. What does the credit card enable its owner to do?
[17:31.16]17. What is true of the cashless society for many Americans?
[17:51.81]18. What is this passage mainly about?
[18:11.32]Passage Two
[18:13.51]Did you know that there's a kind of bird that can sew?
[18:17.85]This bird, called the "Tailor Bird",
[18:20.20]uses its mouth as a needle.
[18:22.79]It sews leaves together in the shape of a cup.
[18:26.04]Then it adds a layer of straw to the inside of the cup
[18:29.83]and lays its eggs there.
[18:32.07]Each bird species builds its own special kind of nest.
[18:36.31]The most common materials used for nests are grasses,
[18:40.75]branches, and feathers.
[18:42.89]A bird must weave these materials into a nest.
[18:46.79]Just imagine building a house without cement or nails to hold it together!
[18:52.36]Another bird is called the "Weaver Bird".
[18:56.32]The "Weaver Bird" builds a nest that looks like a basket.
[19:00.50]The nest does shape like a pear with a hole in the middle.
[19:04.59]The hole is the door of the nest.
[19:07.67]A third bird is called the "Oven Bird".
[19:11.02]The "Oven Bird" makes a nest that is very solid.
[19:15.11]The nest is made of mud.
[19:17.01]The "Oven Bird" forms the mud into the shape of an oven,
[19:21.36]and then lets it dry in the sun.
[19:23.65]The sun bakes the mud, making it very hard.
[19:27.32]Not all birds make their homes in branches.
[19:30.87]Some birds build their nests on the ground
[19:33.96]while others bury their eggs under the ground,
[19:36.99]and some birds do not build nests at all.
[19:40.31]So when you look for nests and eggs in the branches of trees and bushes,
[19:45.15]remember that some nests may be right under your feet.
[19:51.53]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:57.46]19. What does the nest built by a Tailor Bird look like?
[20:18.62]20. Why is there a hole in the Weaver Bird's nest?
[20:38.25]21. What is the Oven Bird's nest made of?
22. What might surprise us about birds' nests according to the speaker?
[21:18.56]Passage Three
[21:20.51]My father woke me up early one morning when I was fourteen,
[21:24.10]and announced "Get up! You are going with me to cut grass."
[21:27.94]I felt proud and excited,
[21:30.18]because my father thought I was responsible enough
[21:33.27]to help him in his business.
[21:35.06]Still, that first day was very hard.
[21:38.13]From sunrise to sunset, my father, my younger brother and I
[21:42.42]cut and trimmed very large yards in a well-to-do part of the city.
[21:47.31]By the end of the day, I was exhausted, but I felt good.
[21:51.09]I had put in a hard day's labor and had earned six dollars.
[21:55.49]One day, my father spotted some leaves I had missed cutting,
[21:59.90]and pulled me aside. "Cut that section again," he said firmly,
[22:03.80]"and don't make me have to tell you to do it again."
[22:07.05]The message was clear.
[22:08.40]Today, I stress the importance of doing a job right the first time.
[22:13.48]Every job I have held, from cutting lawns to washing dishes
[22:17.42]to working a machine on the construction site,
[22:20.11]I have learned something that helps me in my next job.
[22:23.15]If you work hard enough, you can learn from any job you do.
[22:28.93]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:36.18]23. How did the speaker feel when his father asked him to help cut grass?
[22:57.56]24. What did his father do when the speaker missed cutting some leaves?
[23:18.89]25. What did the speaker want to tell us in this passage?
[23:39.02]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
