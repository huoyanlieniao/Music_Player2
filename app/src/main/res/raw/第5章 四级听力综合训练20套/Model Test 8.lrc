[00:18.61]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:22.35]Section A
[00:24.64]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.69]you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.88]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.77]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:34.21]Both the news report and the questions
[00:36.30]will be spoken only once.
[00:38.79]After you hear a question,
[00:40.73]you must choose the best answer
[00:42.32]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:47.05]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:50.48]with a single line through the centre.
[00:53.27]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:58.69]The United States says
[01:00.48]it is concerned about the Islamic State (IS) group
[01:03.02]attracting recruits and acquiring resources in North Africa.
[01:07.10]The forces fighting against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq
[01:11.14]are retaking ground and oil fields.
[01:13.63]While this is seen as a success,
[01:16.27]one U.S. government official says
[01:17.91]there is concern about recruits coming from Libya and parts of Egypt.
[01:22.19]Anti-IS fighters in the northern part of Iraq are taking back territory
[01:27.51]and oil revenue.
[01:29.11]So IS looks for new sources of income.
[01:31.69]Iraq’s largest oil factory was taken back from Islamic State in October.
[01:37.47]The U.S. president says Islamic State has lost 40 percent of the area
[01:42.30]it once controlled in Iraq.
[01:44.49]In Syria,
[01:45.34]Islamic State controls about 80 percent of the oil fields.
[01:48.92]But one U.S. official says production is slow
[01:52.15]and the group is not earning as much money from oil
[01:54.76]as it once did.
[01:57.25]1. What’s the concern for U.S. government according to the news?
[02:17.80]2. What do we learn about Islamic State from the news report?
[02:38.67]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:43.78]Facebook is launching a new mobile app called Notify
[02:47.81]with subscription content from media partners
[02:51.32]like The Washington Post and Vogue.
[02:53.91]The Notify app lets users subscribe to content
[02:58.04]from media partners on their smart phones.
[03:00.68]Facebook will be able to add news alerts in its daily notifications
[03:05.36]to a global audience.
[03:07.35]Facebook’s “renewed push into mobile news reflects a big,
[03:12.14]global shift in media consumption patterns,”
[03:15.52]said the Financial Times.
[03:17.33]Facebook’s profit and revenue growth reflected this shift in media.
[03:22.51]The world’s largest social media platform said
[03:26.09]its third-quarter revenue grew to 4.5 billion dollars
[03:30.42]on the strength of its mobile advertising.
[03:33.26]Facebook, with 500 million users,
[03:36.69]has doubled its daily page views to 8 billion since April.
[03:41.57]The company also owns Instagram,
[03:44.21]a mobile photo and video-sharing app with 400 million users.
[03:49.33]Analysts were optimistic about Instagram’s future growth.
[03:55.57]3. What do we learn about Notify from the news report?
[04:15.31]4. What is Analysts’ attitude towards Instagram’s future?
[04:35.40]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:41.36]There was a surprising finish to this year’s Miss Universe contest.
[04:45.19]At first, it looked as if Colombia’s contestant had won.
[04:49.17]But it turned out the show’s host announced the wrong winner.
[04:53.45]Steve Harvey read the name of the second-place finisher,
[04:57.29]Ariadna Gutierrez Arevalo,
[04:59.63]as the new Miss Universe.
[05:01.48]She and Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach of Philippines,
[05:05.21]who thought she had finished second, hugged.
[05:07.80]Arevalo accepted the crown and waved to the crowd,
[05:11.88]thinking she was the winner.
[05:13.48]Harvey then realized he made a mistake.
[05:16.72]“I have to apologize,” he said,
[05:19.26]while standing next to Arevalo.
[05:21.55]Then he awarded the crown to the real winner.
[05:24.78]The crown went to Wurtzbach.
[05:26.72]Wurtzbach looked shocked.
[05:28.51]Arevalo looked confused.
[05:30.75]The audience screamed.
[05:32.35]It was an awkward moment for everyone.
[05:34.93]Harvey said he misread the card he had been given.
[05:38.72]The episode led to a long night of confusion,
[05:41.85]hurt feelings and apologies.
[05:43.94]"Nobody feels worse than me,”
[05:46.63]Harvey told reporters after the show.
[05:48.77]Harvey wrote about the mistake on Twitter,
[05:51.55]saying,
[05:52.40]"I'd like to apologize wholeheartedly to Miss Colombia
[05:56.43]and Miss Philippines for my huge mistake.
[05:59.41]I feel terrible.”
[06:02.85]5. What is the news report mainly about?
[06:22.57]6. Who actually won the Miss Universe?
[06:40.93]7. What led to the mistake?
[07:00.41]Section B
[07:02.00]Directions: In this section,
[07:04.84]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:07.33]At the end of each conversation,
[07:09.37]you will hear four questions.
[07:11.26]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:13.70]will be spoken only once.
[07:15.74]After you hear a question,
[07:17.53]you must choose the best answer
[07:19.37]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:24.85]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:28.58]with a single line through the centre.
[07:31.38]Conversation One
[07:34.37]M: I am so relieved I just finished the story
[07:37.92]I was working on for our creative writing course.
[07:41.05]W: I haven't quite finished mine yet.
[07:43.84]I had trouble getting past the beginning.
[07:46.63]M: How come?
[07:47.82]W: Well, I was really happy to be writing a detective story.
[07:52.65]But after the first few pages,
[07:55.53]I sort of froze up mentally.
[07:57.92]I just couldn't write any more.
[08:00.17]M: The same thing happened to me.
[08:02.42]I thought it meant I lack imagination.
[08:05.46]W: Well, Prof. Wilson said it's pretty common for writers
[08:09.93]to get stuck like that.
[08:11.45]M: You went to talk to her about it?
[08:14.25]W: Actually, I went to ask for more time to finish the assignment.
[08:19.03]But instead she gave me some advice
[08:21.31]about how to keep from getting stalled writing like that.
[08:25.15]She said that the first thing I should do
[08:27.88]is just write anything that come into my head
[08:30.87]even if it doesn't make any sense,
[08:33.56]sort of warm up exercise.
[08:36.29]M: That's interesting.
[08:38.03]When I get stuck,
[08:39.92]I shift to something else, you know,
[08:42.06]do some work for one of my other courses.
[08:45.35]W: Well, her methods seem to have worked for me.
[08:48.58]I've written most of the story,
[08:51.02]and I should be able to hand it in on time.
[08:54.36]But first I need go to the jewelry store.
[08:58.28]M: You are going shopping?
[09:00.57]Can't you wait until you finish your story?
[09:03.68]W: I am going there for my story.
[09:06.36]My detective solves a jewelry store robbery.
[09:09.50]So I want to take a look at
[09:11.99]how the jewelry cases are arranged,
[09:14.60]where the security cameras are located,
[09:17.17]that sort of thing.
[09:19.43]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:25.40]8. What are the speakers talking about?
[09:44.15]9. What was the woman’s problem?
[10:02.57]10. What did the professor tell the woman to do?
[10:22.36]11. Why is the woman going out?
[10:41.49]Conversation Two
[10:44.05]M: Oh, hi, this book is due today,
[10:47.68]and I am not quite finished with it.
[10:50.12]Is it possible to get it renewed?
[10:52.46]W: Hmmm, French Art & Architecture of the 19th century.
[10:57.29]I'll have to check to see if that's possible.
[11:00.62]Can I have the book and your library card please?
[11:05.05]M: Sure, here you are.
[11:07.26]I just need it for a few more days if possible.
[11:11.22]W: Well, first of all this book is one week late,
[11:15.50]and not due today as you thought.
[11:17.93]It appears you have your dates mixed up.
[11:21.17]M: Oh. Gosh!
[11:22.76]W: There are also a few requests for this book
[11:25.80]so it is now on hold for the next person.
[11:28.58]Now there's a small fine on your card
[11:31.77]of $1.40 for the overdue book,
[11:35.05]would you like to pay this today?
[11:37.75]M: Umm, so if I pay the fine today,
[11:40.84]can I take this book out again?
[11:43.32]W: You won't be able to take this book out again
[11:46.26]until all the other people who have placed holds on it have signed it out.
[11:51.48]Did you want to pay your fine today?
[11:54.47]M: Have you already processed the return on the book?
[11:58.00]I hope to keep it for a few more days.
[12:00.99]I really need it to study.
[12:03.28]The exam is in two days
[12:05.83]and this is practically the course text book.
[12:08.92]W: Sorry, I have already signed it back in
[12:12.22]and now the book is on hold.
[12:14.51]In fact if I could,
[12:16.80]I would triple your fines and suspend your library privileges.
[12:21.43]It's not fair to all the other students
[12:24.08]who are also trying to access library material for study purpose.
[12:29.24]Perhaps you should think of the other people
[12:32.09]who also need this book to study.
[12:34.68]Now are you going to pay your fine today?
[12:37.96]M: OK. Sorry.
[12:41.71]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:48.13]12. What is the man’s problem?
[13:06.18]13. On what condition can the man have the book again?
[13:26.28]14. Why is the book on hold now?
[13:45.23]15. What is the man likely to do next?
[14:04.54]Section C
[14:07.02]Directions: In this section,
[14:10.27]you will hear three short passages.
[14:12.31]At the end of each passage,
[14:14.05]you will hear some questions.
[14:15.99]Both the passage and the questions
[14:17.93]will be spoken only once.
[14:20.17]After you hear a question,
[14:21.96]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[14:24.80]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:29.23]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:32.71]with a single line through the centre.
[14:35.95]Passage One
[14:38.23]Requesting someone's business card is a straightforward process.
[14:44.20]You need only say,
[14:45.95]"Do you have a business card?"
[14:48.53]or "May I have your business card?"
[14:52.25]When you want to present your own card,
[14:55.29]you can say,
[14:57.08]"Here's my card.
[14:58.92]Please feel free to call me if you have any suggestions."
[15:04.42]If you wish to offer your card to a long-time associate,
[15:09.29]you can say,
[15:10.84]"Did I ever give you my card?"
[15:14.02]or "I mean to give you my card."
[15:17.61]It's not polite to directly refuse a request
[15:21.84]from someone for your business card.
[15:24.57]Instead, you can say,
[15:27.16]"Sorry, but I'm afraid I'm all out at the moment."
[15:31.23]or "I neglected to bring them with me."
[15:35.61]Giving someone your card, of course,
[15:39.01]does not obligate you to continue contact,
[15:42.59]nor does accepting someone else's card.
[15:46.67]When you do receive a card,
[15:49.01]say "Thank you."
[15:50.45]and examine it briefly before putting it away.
[15:54.68]You can use a business card that you received
[15:58.31]to refresh your memory about someone's name and title
[16:02.04]before your next meeting.
[16:04.69]You can also record notes about the meeting
[16:08.04]on the back of the card,
[16:09.80]or place it in your card file.
[16:13.44]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:19.39]16. Which of the following is an impolite behavior
[16:25.26]according to the passage?
[16:41.74]17. What should we do when accepting a business card?
[17:01.45]18. What's the function of a business card according to the passage?
[17:23.37]Passage Two
[17:26.22]If you are someone who tends to focus on the negative,
[17:30.63]thinking positively may be a new skill for you.
[17:35.16]One way to keep a positive attitude about yourself
[17:39.73]is by writing down and saying several sentences.
[17:44.36]The sentences should be strong,
[17:46.89]supportive statements about yourself
[17:49.43]such as "I am a confident and capable person
[17:54.50]who can handle challenges."
[17:56.79]It's hard to feel defeated when your self-talk is positive.
[18:02.27]Another technique for reducing stress is positive images.
[18:07.94]When confronted with a problem,
[18:10.28]try to imagine the outcome that you want.
[18:13.66]This technique is used by sport professionals
[18:17.36]with tremendous success.
[18:20.10]You too can champion your cause
[18:23.44]by mentally picturing positive results.
[18:26.88]Sometimes people are faced
[18:29.07]with unfortunate circumstances that can not be changed.
[18:34.45]In these instances,
[18:36.39]it may help to think about some of the assets and resources
[18:41.31]that you have that can support you and help you cope
[18:46.09]such as family, friends, skills, education,
[18:50.72]money and good health.
[18:53.49]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:59.32]19. What is mainly discussed in the passage?
[19:18.24]20. How can we imagine positively?
[19:37.43]21. How should we face the unchangeable misfortune?
[19:57.46]Passage Three
[20:00.26]A fellow had just been hired
[20:02.55]as the new CEO of a large high-tech corporation.
[20:07.83]The CEO who was stepping down
[20:10.91]met with him privately and presented him
[20:14.62]with three numbered envelopes.
[20:17.61]"Open these if you run up against a problem
[20:20.98]you don't think you can solve," he said.
[20:24.11]Well, things went along pretty smoothly,
[20:28.45]but six months later,
[20:30.59]sales took a decline and he was really under the pressure.
[20:35.87]He remembered the envelopes.
[20:38.66]He went to his drawer and took out the first envelope.
[20:42.99]The message read, "Blame your former CEO."
[20:47.65]The new CEO called a press conference
[20:50.89]and laid all the faults on the previous CEO.
[20:55.37]Satisfied with his comments,
[20:57.51]the press responded positively,
[21:00.85]sales began to pick up and the problem was soon behind him.
[21:06.32]About a year later, the company was again
[21:10.00]experiencing serious product problems.
[21:14.28]Having learned from his previous experience,
[21:18.01]the CEO quickly opened the second envelope.
[21:22.21]The message read, "Reorganize".
[21:25.75]Then he did,
[21:27.54]and the company quickly reorganized.
[21:30.47]After several months,
[21:32.61]the company once again fell on difficult times.
[21:36.55]The CEO went to his office,
[21:39.43]closed the door and opened the third envelope.
[21:43.56]The message said, "Prepare three envelopes".
[21:49.96]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[21:56.28]22. From whom did the new CEO get three envelopes?
[22:17.22]23. In the first half year,
[22:21.35]how did the business go?
[22:37.79]24. What was the message in the first envelope?
[22:57.53]25. What did the last envelope mean?
[23:16.36]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
