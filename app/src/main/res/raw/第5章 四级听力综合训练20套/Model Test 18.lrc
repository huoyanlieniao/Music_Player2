[00:15.34]College English Test - Band 4
[00:18.98]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:22.53]Section A
[00:24.68]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.66]you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.80]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.65]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:33.99]Both the news report and the questions
[00:36.60]will be spoken only once.
[00:38.64]After you hear a question,
[00:40.43]you must choose the best answer
[00:42.23]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:46.92]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:50.31]with a single line through the centre.
[00:53.65]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:59.00]Two US Marine helicopters have bumped 
[01:01.69]near the Hawaiian island of Oahu, 
[01:04.20]each with six people on board. 
[01:06.69]The crash occurred during a night-time training mission 
[01:09.94]late on Thursday but it is unclear why.
[01:13.29]Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Sara Mooers said 
[01:16.68]wrecks were seen in the ocean. 
[01:18.13]Marine Capt Timothy Irish told the Associated Press news agency 
[01:22.46]that a search and rescue was under way 
[01:24.76]for the two CH-53 transport helicopters. 
[01:27.85]The aircraft were from the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing 
[01:31.94]from Marine Corps Base Hawaii, 
[01:34.06]he said.
[01:35.15]Ms Mooers told Los Angeles radio station KNX-AM 
[01:38.78]that the search would be tough 
[01:40.36]because of darkness and a high surf advisory. 
[01:43.95]Less than a year ago, 
[01:45.11]a Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey crashed during a training exercise, 
[01:50.08]killing two Marines.
[01:52.92]1. What do we learn about the accident from the news report?
[02:13.87]2. Why was the search difficult according to Ms Mooers?
[02:34.38]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:39.65]US Secretary of defense Chuck Hagel recently met with Colombian leaders 
[02:44.74]as part of a six-day visit to South America. 
[02:48.38]“Colombia,” said Mr. Hagel, 
[02:50.43]“continues to expand its role as a security exporter, 
[02:54.92]having helped train tens of thousands of security personnel 
[02:59.24]for more than 40 nations.”
[03:01.25]The Colombian military has practiced its skills
[03:04.90]in the decades-long battle 
[03:06.59]against the revolutionary armed forces of Colombia, 
[03:09.95]known as the FARC, 
[03:12.18]while combining protection of human rights 
[03:14.63]as an integral part of its belief. 
[03:17.85]“Through initiatives such as our joint action plan 
[03:21.69]on regional security cooperation, 
[03:24.34]Colombia and the United States continue to work together 
[03:28.83]to build security across this hemisphere and beyond.”
[03:33.52]The United States has provided over 50 million dollars
[03:37.71]in defense funding to Colombia in the last financial year, 
[03:42.43]as part of 324 million dollars in bilateral programs 
[03:47.88]supporting human rights and the rule of law, 
[03:51.13]economic development, 
[03:52.62]and efforts to combat transnational crime.
[03:58.60]3. What did the Colombian military bring into its belief?
[04:18.98]4. How much defense funding is being provided by the United States?
[04:39.88]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:45.06]PCBs, were manufactured from the 1920s, 
[04:48.21]but were banned in the US in 1979, 
[04:51.06]in the UK in 1981 and in the rest of the EU in 1987.
[04:57.19]They were found to have a wide-ranging impact 
[04:59.68]on human and animal health, 
[05:01.54]from links to cancer, 
[05:03.19]to restraining the immune system 
[05:05.23]and causing reproductive problems. 
[05:07.36]However, 
[05:08.16]these chemicals are extremely durable and despite the ban 
[05:11.30]they are still found in the environment.
[05:13.85]“Europe produced about 300,000 tonnes of PCBs from 1954 to 1984. 
[05:20.24]That was about 15% of the world’s total,” said Dr Jepson. 
[05:24.81]“A lot of this PCB, 
[05:26.91]we don’t know how much, 
[05:28.45]has not been dealt with and is slowly leaking into rivers, 
[05:31.70]from landfills, 
[05:33.01]and eventually into the marine environment.” 
[05:35.88]The chemicals then gradually work their way up the food chain 
[05:39.45]and into the top marine animals.
[05:41.69]The researchers analysed samples 
[05:43.74]taken from more than 1,000 killer whales and dolphins in Europe’s waters. 
[05:48.54]“Our findings show that, 
[05:50.44]despite the ban and initial decline in environmental pollution, 
[05:54.13]PCBs still persist at dangerously high levels in European whales,” 
[05:59.31]explained Dr Jepson.
[06:02.93]5. When were the PCBs banned in the UK?
[06:23.55]6. Why should PCBs be banned according to the news report?
[06:45.14]7. What do we learn about PCBs from the research?
[07:05.44]Section B
[07:07.24]Directions: In this section,
[07:09.74]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:12.09]At the end of each conversation,
[07:13.84]you will hear four questions.
[07:16.11]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:18.46]will be spoken only once.
[07:20.45]After you hear a question,
[07:22.30]you must choose the best answer
[07:24.20]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:29.44]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:33.33]with a single line through the centre.
[07:36.43]Conversation One
[07:39.61]W: Stan, do you have a minute?
[07:42.53]M: Oh, hi, Cathy, sure. What's up?
[07:46.74]W: I've been meaning to talk to you
[07:48.60]about the situation in the office.
[07:51.69]M: I'm not in that very often.
[07:54.70]It's so noisy that I can't work.
[07:58.60]W: That's exactly what I'm getting at.
[08:00.90]We're supposed to be able to do our preparation
[08:03.04]and marking in that office.
[08:05.18]But have you noticed?
[08:07.28]Jack constantly has students coming in
[08:09.54]to get help with his course.
[08:11.79]A lot of people are going in and out.
[08:15.16]M: Has anyone spoken to him about it?
[08:17.56]W: No, not yet. But someone's going to have to.
[08:22.35]M: We really can't ask him
[08:23.85]to stop having students come in for help, can we?
[08:27.50]W: No, of course not.
[08:30.04]But I'm not able to do my work and neither are you.
[08:33.83]I imagine it's the same for the others in the office.
[08:37.52]M: Hum... could we ask for a kind of meeting room?
[08:41.47]When TAs have to talk with the students,
[08:44.51]they could go to the meeting room and not use the office.
[08:48.13]You know, there's a room down the hall,
[08:51.01]a rather small room that we could ask to use.
[08:54.88]It's only for storing supplies.
[08:57.52]W: You mean that little storage room?
[09:00.26]Oh, that would be too small.
[09:02.65]M: Are you sure? With the cabinets taken out,
[09:06.46]it might be bigger than it looks.
[09:09.29]W: Come to think of it, you may be on to something.
[09:12.59]I'd like to take a look at that room. Can we go there now?
[09:16.39]M: Sure, let's go.
[09:19.94]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:25.73]8. What problem at the office are Cathy and Stan discussing?
[09:45.90]9. Why do Jack’s students come to see him?
[10:05.25]10. What does Stan suggest they do?
[10:24.13]11. What does Cathy say about Stan’s suggestion?
[10:43.96]Conversation Two
[10:46.55]M: The weather forecast says it will rain today.
[10:49.74]W: Yeah, doesn't it always?
[10:52.24]They've been saying that for a week
[10:54.43]and I haven't seen much sign of it so far.
[10:57.20]M: Yeah, but look. This time maybe they're on target.
[11:01.24]The sky's very dark. I got a feeling the rain will be heavy.
[11:05.98]W: If it's raining heavily after class,
[11:08.67]wait for me and I'll bring you an umbrella.
[11:11.67]M: That's kind of you to offer,
[11:13.21]but don't worry I'll probably just wait it out.
[11:16.80]W: By the way, what are the chances
[11:19.99]that you might be able to have a word
[11:22.09]with Professor Simpson in Criminology class?
[11:26.16]We still need some resources for our Psychology project
[11:29.69]and his input might help.
[11:32.38]M: I could ask him,
[11:33.68]although I don't know how eager
[11:35.73]he'd be to give us information about such a topic.
[11:39.22]W: Oh, come on, he's always so helpful.
[11:43.59]Why would he even hesitate?
[11:45.79]M: Well, he has this mind set,
[11:48.09]which opposes the notion that criminals
[11:50.39]must necessarily be psychologically abnormal.
[11:53.80]He feels it's just a stereotype.
[11:56.89]W: Ok. But when it comes to certain crimes like mass murder,
[12:01.58]there must be a few "marbles loose".
[12:04.87]M: You would think so.
[12:06.23]But it's hard to convince Simpson that anyone's crazy.
[12:09.76]W: Perhaps he'd make a good reference source in the section
[12:13.46]where we include counter-arguments to our main thesis.
[12:17.56]M: Good thinking. Let's give it a shot.
[12:19.85]W: That's the spirit!
[12:23.78]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:30.66]12. Why does the woman seem unconvinced that it will rain today?
[12:51.73]13. Why do the man and woman want to talk to Mr. Simpson?
[13:12.99]14. What is Simpson’s view towards criminals?
[13:33.14]15. What will the two speakers probably do?
[13:53.57]Section C
[13:55.15]Directions: In this section,
[13:58.45]you will hear three short passages.
[14:00.70]At the end of each passage,
[14:02.04]you will hear some questions.
[14:04.03]Both the passage and the questions
[14:05.98]will be spoken only once.
[14:08.38]After you hear a question,
[14:09.86]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[14:12.82]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:17.35]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:20.56]with a single line through the centre.
[14:24.35]Passage One
[14:26.33]Yellow Pages advertising is directory advertising
[14:30.41]because it tells people where to go to get the product or service.
[14:34.74]It reaches prospects-people who already know
[14:38.68]they have a need for the product or service.
[14:42.12]Directory advertising is the only form of advertising
[14:46.36]that is actively consulted by prospects
[14:49.19]who need or want to buy something.
[14:52.91]Yellow Pages advertising is the most widely used form
[14:56.88]of directory advertising.
[14:59.49]It is the most universal of advertising medium.
[15:03.97]For some small business,
[15:06.02]the advertising is generated from local businesses.
[15:10.40]A Yellow Pages ad is the last step
[15:13.89]in the search for a product or service by a committed consumer.
[15:18.88]The Yellow Pages are used primarily for comparison shopping.
[15:25.16]Although the advertisement doesn't have to attract the attention
[15:28.96]of an indifferent audience,
[15:30.91]it does have to stand out in a competitive environment.
[15:35.26]The decision about which store to call or visit
[15:38.31]will be based on certain criteria,
[15:40.85]the size of the ad being the first.
[15:43.79]Larger ads get more attention than small ones.
[15:48.53]Other decision factors include convenience,
[15:51.57]range of products or services,
[15:54.01]and the reputation or image of the store.
[15:57.66]The most important feature of Yellow Pages advertising is the category system.
[16:03.48]Certain information is critical to Yellow Pages ads
[16:07.61]including location, hours and graphics.
[16:11.66]A recent development in directory advertising
[16:15.17]is the electronic Yellow Pages,
[16:17.61]a database accessed by computer.
[16:21.73]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:28.11]16. What is the basic use for the Yellow Pages?
[16:47.94]17. What is the most important design part of a Yellow Pages ad?
[17:08.87]18. What is the latest invention in directory advertising?
[17:29.41]Passage Two
[17:31.81]One of the complaints of city residents,
[17:33.94]not surprisingly, is the lack of parking.
[17:37.39]This problem is partly caused
[17:39.49]by all the abandoned cars on the streets.
[17:42.85]It has been estimated by A to Z Towing Inc.,
[17:45.99]a nationwide tow-truck agency,
[17:48.08]that over one million cars are abandoned on the streets
[17:51.71]and alleyways of the nation's cities.
[17:54.74]Each year, approximately a third of those cars are removed and destroyed.
[17:59.87]The rest of the cars, which are not removed,
[18:02.82]take up parking spaces and make neighborhoods look rundown.
[18:08.28]A survey of twenty cities by A to Z reports
[18:11.77]that as much as 30 million dollars is spent annually
[18:15.31]to tow away and dismantle abandoned vehicles.
[18:19.15]One city alone, Los Angeles, spends five million dollars a year
[18:23.88]to control the accumulation of abandoned cars on its streets.
[18:28.21]Even though the city spends so much money on the program,
[18:32.15]it is always fighting a losing battle
[18:34.62]as more and more cars are constantly coming off the production line.
[18:40.37]Boston, on the other hand,
[18:41.83]which spends most of its money on museums and libraries,
[18:45.05]does not appropriate tax money to clear abandoned cars off the streets.
[18:49.70]In Boston the problem has been dealt with
[18:51.99]by a non-profit government agency called Street Horizons,
[18:55.83]which uses the money from the recycling of metal in the cars
[18:59.01]to pay for the cost of towing them.
[19:02.25]The program in Boston sounds good
[19:04.14]although it has not completely reached financial independence
[19:07.42]from the federal government yet.
[19:09.96]Until a truly self-sufficient program for removing old cars is developed,
[19:14.24]it will remain a serious problem.
[19:18.19]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:23.38]19. How many cars are towed from the streets each year?
[19:44.58]20. What is Street Horizons?
[20:04.13]21. What is the problem with abandoned cars?
[20:24.97]Passage Three
[20:27.56]Albert Schweitzer was born in 1875 in Alsace.
[20:33.26]At that time, it was a part of Germany.
[20:37.26]His generous spirit was first awakened through his training as a preacher.
[20:42.97]Besides gaining a reputation as a preacher,
[20:46.32]he also became respected for his ability to play the organ.
[20:51.14]He was a man of many talents.
[20:53.83]His concern for other people turned his attention to medicine.
[20:58.66]He had also acquired doctoral degrees in philosophy and music.
[21:04.35]His wife took an interest in medicine also and became a nurse.
[21:09.44]Many people thought that he should remain
[21:11.54]and lecture in Europe to have a strong impact on Western civilization.
[21:16.68]Though he listened to their suggestions,
[21:19.04]he ultimately decided to follow his own conscience.
[21:23.07]This led him to Africa.
[21:25.51]Albert had felt that all men
[21:27.65]should accept the responsibility of helping others.
[21:31.96]He felt particularly concerned for black Africans
[21:35.21]who had been exploited by white men.
[21:37.99]He earned the money he needed
[21:39.75]by performing on the organ and by lecturing.
[21:43.22]With this money he bought equipment and opened a hospital in Africa.
[21:48.27]He was a man of great strength who faced great problems with courage.
[21:53.95]The treat of war, the reality of imprisonment during World War One
[21:58.99]as a German citizen and the unbearable heat in Africa
[22:03.02]did not make him retreat at all.
[22:05.82]He believed that a man could overcome these obstacles
[22:09.01]if he had a sense of idealism. He died in 1965.
[22:16.05]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:22.49]22. How was Albert's generous spirit awakened?
[22:42.70]23. What was he respected for?
[23:01.79]24. According to Albert, what should all men accept?
[23:23.10]25. What is true of Albert?
[23:42.13]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[23:45.38]
