[00:19.83]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:23.38]Section A
[00:25.43]Directions: In this section,
[00:29.30]you will hear three news reports.
[00:32.19]At the end of each news report,
[00:34.48]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:38.53]Both the news report and the questions
[00:41.12]will be spoken only once.
[00:44.29]After you hear a question,
[00:45.94]you must choose the best answer
[00:48.20]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:54.65]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:58.70]with a single line through the centre.
[01:02.50]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[01:09.19]The traditional two-party system of Spanish politics has been shaken up 
[01:14.28]by the success of two new movements in the country’s general elections. 
[01:19.26]With nearly all votes counted, 
[01:21.95]the governing Popular Party is forecast to lose its majority in congress 
[01:27.69]while still winning most seats. 
[01:30.87]The Socialist Party finished second, 
[01:33.27]closely followed by Podemos Party which won about 20 percent. 
[01:38.50]Its leader Pedro Sanchez said it was the beginning of a new political era. 
[01:44.97]Today is an historic day for Spain. 
[01:48.69]We’re very happy for the fact that in Spain, 
[01:52.23]the two-party system is ended and we’re happy 
[01:56.07]because we are starting a new political era in our country. 
[02:00.17]The results mean that Spain’s political parties are set for days 
[02:04.85]or even weeks of difficult negotiations. 
[02:08.75]The new groupings of Podemos and the Citizen’s Party 
[02:12.53]will play an important role in deciding the make-up of any government.
[02:20.36]1. What does the Podemos Party rank in the election?
[02:40.19]2. How is the relationship among the political parties?
[03:01.28]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[03:10.18]The Prime Minister of Samoa says 77 people were killed 
[03:13.86]and 150 injured by a tsunami in the South Pacific. 
[03:21.65]At least 24 people died on American Samoa. 
[03:24.24]Thousands of people’s homes have been destroyed 
[03:27.49]and the final number of deaths is expected to be higher 
[03:29.43]as reports from Sydney.
[03:33.31]A cruel act of nature has destroyed parts of Samoa 
[03:35.56]and neighboring American Samoa. 
[03:38.10]The rescue effort is continuing 
[03:38.04]with pledges of international support led by the United States. 
[03:41.98]The number of dead has slowly increased 
[03:44.24]since the tsunami struck after dawn 
[03:46.66]and there are fears it will keep on rising 
[03:49.52]as emergency teams reach isolated areas. 
[03:52.45]Foreign tourists including a British baby 
[03:55.52]and a 6-year-old Australian girl are among the deaths. 
[03:59.40]Officials believe 
[04:00.29]that many of the victims were washed out to sea 
[04:03.00]as their homes were destroyed by waves 
[04:05.46]reportedly up to 11 meters high.
[04:10.16]3. How many people were killed by the tsunami on American Samoa?
[04:31.73]4. What do we learn about the tsunami from the news report?
[04:52.36]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[05:00.31]Government and health officials are trying 
[05:02.77]to help thousands of sick people there 
[05:05.45]who have all been diagnosed with cholera. 
[05:08.39]It’s an illness caused by a bacteria, 
[05:11.04]and people usually get it from food or water 
[05:14.43]that’s been contaminated. 
[05:16.51]Cholera can be treated. 
[05:18.52]But in severe cases, 
[05:20.46]the disease can be fatal. 
[05:22.61]More than 250 people have died 
[05:25.85]from the recent cholera outbreak in Haiti. 
[05:29.19]Part of the problem is 
[05:30.79]that parts of Haiti haven’t recovered from that massive earthquake 
[05:35.02]back in January. 
[05:37.03]People are still living in tents, 
[05:38.98]and they don’t have access to clean water.
[05:42.08]Health professionals know 
[05:43.69]that they may be at a tipping point with this outbreak. 
[05:47.63]They want to do all they can to contain it. 
[05:50.71]They are stepping up the condition at public toilet. 
[05:54.01]They are opening hand centers in order to clean your hands. 
[05:58.50]They are having water deliveries to these areas. 
[06:01.93]They are also having trucks on standby 
[06:05.33]in order to take people throughout the night to hospitals 
[06:09.01]if they feel sick. 
[06:10.56]And they are setting up, 
[06:11.96]as a preventive measure, 
[06:13.76]isolation areas.
[06:18.24]5. What do we know about cholera from the news report?
[06:38.18]6. Why did so many people die recently in Haiti?
[06:57.92]7. What measure was taken to contain the spread of cholera?
[07:18.90]Section B
[07:20.75]Directions: In this section,
[07:24.09]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:27.46]At the end of each conversation,
[07:29.91]you will hear four questions.
[07:32.69]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:35.65]will be spoken only once.
[07:38.38]After you hear a question,
[07:40.32]you must choose the best answer
[07:42.88]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:48.87]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:53.16]with a single line through the centre.
[07:56.46]Conversation One
[08:00.42]W: Hi. How can we help you today?
[08:02.94]M: Yeah. I'd like to get my hair trimmed a little.
[08:06.12]Nothing fancy. Just a basic trim.
[08:08.37]W: Well, can we interest you in today's special?
[08:11.97]M: Um... No...
[08:13.51]W: We'll shampoo, cut, and style your hair
[08:16.71]for one unbelievable low price of $9.99.
[08:20.97]Plus, we'll give you a clean shave
[08:23.66]and a back massage to help you relax.
[08:26.81]Best service in town!
[08:28.65]M: Okay, I'll have the complete service today,
[08:30.96]but as I said before, I just want to get my hair trimmed.
[08:34.36]A little off the top and sides. That's all. I mean, that's all.
[08:38.01]W: No problem. Relax. You're in good hands.
[08:42.33]Okay, here we go. So, what do you do for a living?
[08:47.81]M: I'm a lawyer, specializing in workplace accidents,
[08:51.21]and I'm in town for an interview for a new job, and...
[08:54.26]Hey, what happened to my hair?
[08:56.30]And what's left of my hair turned purple.
[08:58.84]Are you even a licensed beautician?
[09:01.03]W: Well, sir. We offer a money-back guarantee on all our work,
[09:06.16]so if you're not completely satisfied...
[09:08.34]M: Satisfied? I'm anything but satisfied.
[09:11.03]How in the world am I supposed to go to a job interview looking like this?
[09:15.09]Forget it. Forget it.
[09:20.22]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:27.30]8. What is one service NOT included 
[09:30.93]in the special price at the beauty salon?
[09:48.90]9. Why does the man repeatedly say “That’s all”?
[10:08.87]10. What does the beautician mean by “You’re in good hands”? 
[10:29.46]11. Why does the customer go to this beauty salon 
[10:33.70]to improve his appearance?
[10:51.11]Conversation Two
[10:55.11]W: Hello, Sam. This is Paula Hanson.
[10:57.71]Sorry to bother you, but I'm having a small problem
[11:01.99]I thought you might be able to help me with.
[11:04.58]M: Sure, Paula. What's up?
[11:05.88]W: Well, you know
[11:07.39]Sarah and I moved into an off-campus apartment in the fall.
[11:12.09]The dishwasher broke down,
[11:14.08]so we reported it to Ms. Corners, the owner.
[11:17.88]She said she'd take care of it, but a month went by and nothing happened.
[11:22.66]M: Did you get back in touch with her?
[11:24.56]W: I got a repairperson to give me an estimate, and then I sent it to her.
[11:29.99]When I didn't hear from her, I had the repair done.
[11:33.39]And I deducted the cost from the rent check.
[11:36.15]M: So what's the problem?
[11:37.59]W: She called here. Very Angry.
[11:40.32]She said she could have gotten the repair done for less money.
[11:44.52]Now, she's threatening to force us to leave for not paying the full rent.
[11:49.50]M: Hold on, Paula. It does sound pretty serious.
[11:51.99]But I'm sure you can all sit down and work this out.
[11:55.09]W: Well, you're over at the law school.
[11:57.69]So, I wondered if you would mind coming with Sarah and me
[12:01.86]when we go to talk with Ms. Corners.
[12:04.67]We're supposed to meet with her tomorrow night at eight.
[12:07.86]M: Sure. I'll be glad to help you straighten things out.
[12:10.74]Why don't I stop by about 7:30?
[12:13.73]W: Thanks, Sam. You are our lifesaver.
[12:19.93]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:29.37]12. What did Ms. Corners do 
[12:32.83]when she knew the dishwasher broke down?

[13:09.93]14. Why is Ms. Corners angry?
[13:29.85]15. Why does Paula think Sam can help her?
[13:50.42]Section C
[13:52.62]Directions: In this section,
[13:55.41]you will hear three short passages.
[13:58.15]At the end of each passage,
[14:00.40]you will hear some questions.
[14:02.38]Both the passage and the questions
[14:05.13]will be spoken only once.
[14:08.32]After you hear a question,
[14:10.62]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[14:14.50]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:19.29]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:23.46]with a single line through the centre.
[14:27.50]Passage One
[14:30.25]A fox one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape.
[14:36.12]A thirsty goat came to the same well, and seeing the fox,
[14:40.22]inquired if the water was good.
[14:43.15]Concealing his sad situation under a merry guise,
[14:47.00]the fox sang high praise of the water,
[14:49.64]saying it was excellent beyond measure,
[14:52.27]and encouraging him to descend.
[14:54.47]The goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down,
[14:59.30]but just as he drank, the fox informed him of the difficulty
[15:03.59]they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape.
[15:08.01]"If," said he, "you will place your forefeet
[15:10.66]upon the wall and bend your head,
[15:13.36]I will run up your back and escape,
[15:15.95]and will help you out afterwards."
[15:17.89]The goat readily assented and the fox leaped upon his back.
[15:22.53]Steadying himself with the goat's horns,
[15:25.31]he safely reached the mouth of the well
[15:28.21]and made off as fast as he could.
[15:30.36]When the goat blamed the fox for breaking his promise,
[15:33.83]he turned around and cried out, "You foolish old fellow!
[15:37.84]If you had as many brains in your head
[15:40.28]as you have hairs in your beard,
[15:42.12]you would never have gone down
[15:43.89]before you had inspected the way up,
[15:46.33]nor have exposed yourself to dangers
[15:48.67]from which you had no means of escape."
[15:53.21]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:59.36]16. How did the fox come out of the well?
[16:20.14]17. Why did the fox sing high praise of the water?
[16:40.97]18. What does the story try to tell us?
[17:00.82]Passage Two
[17:03.45]Indians are the world's biggest bookworms,
[17:06.19]reading on average 10.7 hours a week,
[17:09.80]twice as long as Americans, according to a new survey.
[17:14.27]The NOP World Culture Score index surveyed 30,000 people
[17:19.93]in 30 countries from December 2004 to February 2005.
[17:26.21]Analysts said the spirit of self-help
[17:29.36]could explain India's high figures.
[17:32.35]Time spent on reading meant fewer hours watching TV
[17:37.08]and listening to the radio
[17:39.07]―India came fourth last in both.
[17:42.13]The NOP survey of 30,000 consumers aged over 13 saw China
[17:48.51]and the Philippines take second and third place respectively
[17:52.61]in average hours a week spent reading books,
[17:56.16]newspapers and magazines.
[17:58.51]Britons and Americans scored about half the Indians' hours
[18:02.59]and Japanese and Koreans were even lower
[18:06.18]―at 4.1 and 3.1 hours respectively.
[18:10.43]R. Sriram, chief executive officer of Crosswords Bookstores,
[18:15.91]a chain of 26 bookshops around India, says "For Indians,
[18:21.41]reading is a fundamental part of their being."
[18:25.36]"They place a great deal of emphasis on reading.
[18:28.84]That's the reason why they do well in education
[18:31.65]and universities abroad," he said.
[18:34.40]"People educate themselves and deal with change throughout their lives.
[18:39.43]And the way to do that is to update themselves with books."
[18:44.17]Mr. Sriram says social changes have also made a difference:
[18:49.06]"Earlier people often turned to their parents
[18:52.61]and grandparents for advice.
[18:54.81]Now they turn to books."
[18:59.10]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:04.75]19. How many hours on average do Americans read a week
[19:08.99]according the survey?
[19:26.14]20. Which country takes the second place in average hours a week
[19:30.23]spent reading books?
[19:48.44]21. Who did Indians often turn to for advice in the past?
[20:10.07]Passage Three
[20:12.42]British police say a second man has been arrested
[20:15.46]in connection with failed bomb attacks
[20:17.84]Thursday on the London transport system.
[20:20.77]Officials say the man was arrested Friday in the same south London area
[20:25.81]where police arrested another suspect earlier in the day.
[20:29.81]Also Friday police shot and killed a man
[20:33.55]at an underground train station in the same area.
[20:36.41]Officials say the shooting was linked to the investigation.
[20:40.37]Police have released pictures of four men
[20:44.06]suspected of attempting to explode bombs on subway trains and a bus.
[20:49.40]An earthquake hit parts of Japan near Tokyo Saturday.
[20:53.05]The earthquake injured at least 18 people.
[20:56.58]At least one building in the Japanese capital was damaged.
[21:00.48]The Haneda and Narita airports closed temporarily to check for damage.
[21:06.16]Officials stopped some of the Japanese high-speed trains
[21:09.80]after the earthquake.
[21:11.55]Japanese officials say the earthquake did not cause any tsunamis.
[21:16.93]North Korea says it does not need to meet directly with Japan
[21:21.02]during 6-party nuclear talks next week.
[21:24.56]The official North Korean news agency
[21:26.55]reported a North Korean objection to Japan's demands that the talks include
[21:31.94]North Korea's kidnapping of Japanese citizens
[21:34.77]during the Cold War period that followed World War II.
[21:38.60]A South Korean diplomat said Friday
[21:41.09]that the talks would involve only nuclear disarmament
[21:44.44]and not other issues.
[21:46.79]He said the countries taking part in the talks have agreed
[21:49.93]that North Korea's human rights record should not be discussed.
[21:55.57]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:01.85]22. How many suspects have been arrested
[22:06.76]related to failed bomb attacks Thursday in London?
[22:25.88]23. What was not the result of the earthquake in Japan?
[22:46.69]24. What would be the key subject of the 6-party talks?
[23:08.68]25. What is Japan's demand for the 6-party talks?
[23:29.09]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[23:32.16]
