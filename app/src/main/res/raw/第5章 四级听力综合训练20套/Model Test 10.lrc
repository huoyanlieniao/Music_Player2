[00:15.43]College English Test - Band 4
[00:19.07]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:22.77]Section A
[00:24.40]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.60]you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.66]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.61]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:33.96]Both the news report and the questions
[00:36.46]will be spoken only once.
[00:38.55]After you hear a question,
[00:40.60]you must choose the best answer
[00:42.31]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:46.99]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:50.15]with a single line through the centre.
[00:53.73]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:58.93]In an unannounced meeting with the Israeli prime minister, 
[01:01.91]Jordan’s King Abdullah put new pressure on Israel 
[01:04.92]to stop building settlements in the West Bank. 
[01:07.37]The Jordanian king met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmet 
[01:11.81]in this Red Sea port of Aqaba, 
[01:13.96]a day after the monarch met with Palestinian Authority President 
[01:17.84]Mahmoud Abbas. 
[01:19.70]A statement from the royal palace said 
[01:21.53]the king urged Israel to avoid “unilateral actions” 
[01:24.97]that could block progress towards peace. 
[01:28.13]King Abdullah warned Mr. Olmert 
[01:30.42]that a stalled peace process “threatens the region’s future, 
[01:34.32]and its security and stability.” 
[01:36.60]A spokesman for Mr. Olmert said 
[01:38.55]the Israeli leader renewed Israel’s commitment 
[01:41.10]not to build new settlements or appropriate new lands 
[01:44.70]in the parts of the West Bank outside East Jerusalem. 
[01:49.91]1. When did the Jordanian king meet with Israeli Prime Minister?
[02:10.97]2. What did King Abdullah urge Israel to do?
[02:30.59]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:35.56]A forty-year-old father of two, 
[02:37.80]Steve Vaught took the final steps of his long journey 
[02:41.68]as he crossed the George Washington Bridge into Manhattan. 
[02:45.42]It took him a year and a month 
[02:47.81]to walk the nearly four thousand eight hundred kilometers 
[02:51.45]from his home in California. 
[02:53.85]His original aim had been to lose weight 
[02:56.59]after falling into a depression and developing an eating disorder. 
[03:00.91]He did arrive a hundred pounds or forty-five kilograms lighter 
[03:05.35]but said he learned that weight loss was more 
[03:08.25]about the state of mind than body. 
[03:11.08]He now realized the secret to becoming thinner was being happier. 
[03:15.88]His voyage of self-discovery was viewed by millions around the world 
[03:20.78]on his website “A Fat Man Walking” 
[03:23.82]and he now plans to publish a book about his experiences. 
[03:27.57]But before disappearing into a hotel, 
[03:30.61]he told reporters his first plan was to put on some new socks.
[03:37.99]3. How long was Steve Vaught’s journey?
[03:57.21]4. What was Steve Vaught’s purpose of his long journey at first?
[04:18.15]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:23.38]In the seaside town of Brighton in southern England 
[04:26.38]the ruling Labor party’s annual conference is holding. 
[04:29.84]It’s a time for both MPs to take stock of how the party is doing, 
[04:34.33]to discuss policy and to hear, hopefully, inspiring speeches. 
[04:39.38]The party delegates will be hoping too 
[04:41.87]for plenty of coverage from the media assembled there. 
[04:45.16]Sometimes in politics it appears it’s not so much what you do 
[04:49.75]but what you seem to be doing that counts, 
[04:52.79]and for politicians public relations can seem to be 
[04:55.77]as important as policies. 
[04:58.18]The BBC’s media correspondent, 
[05:00.48]Torin Douglas, 
[05:01.47]has been considering the relationship between politicians and the press. 
[05:05.77]Who really holds the power? 
[05:08.02]Newspapers in Britain have long had great influence over Governments, 
[05:12.55]much to the resentment of the politicians. 
[05:15.15]Almost seventy-five years ago, 
[05:17.40]the then Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin accused the two big press bosses, 
[05:22.12]Lords Beaverbrook and Rothermere, 
[05:24.93]of running their papers as “engines of promotion” 
[05:27.76]for the “personal wishes and personal dislikes of two men”. 
[05:31.65]It’s hard to imagine the current Prime Minister 
[05:34.56]attacking the small entertaining press so publicly.
[05:40.15]5. What do we learn about the Labor party’s annual conference?
[06:00.94]6. What’s the attitude of politicians toward newspapers?
[06:21.29]7. What did Stanley Baldwin accuse two big press companies of?
[06:42.77]Section B
[06:44.21]Directions: In this section,
[06:46.85]you will hear two long conversations.
[06:49.25]At the end of each conversation,
[06:51.09]you will hear four questions.
[06:53.23]Both the conversation and the questions
[06:55.53]will be spoken only once.
[06:58.08]After you hear a question,
[06:59.37]you must choose the best answer
[07:01.15]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:06.67]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:09.96]with a single line through the centre.
[07:13.58]Conversation One
[07:16.71]M: You like living in the city, don't you?
[07:19.46]W: Oh, I love it.
[07:21.41]It's so convenient.
[07:23.85]I can take the bus to work, or the subway, or the taxi.
[07:28.65]And there is so much to do.
[07:31.54]M: I know what you mean.
[07:33.89]I'd like to live in the city,
[07:36.27]but to live in the suburbs is better for children.
[07:41.38]W: Well, there are a lot of good things about suburban living.
[07:46.56]But, as a working woman,
[07:49.31]I think a city has all the conveniences
[07:53.15]―including the best food and fastest news.
[07:57.52]M: But there are more trees, grass and fresh air in the suburbs.
[08:04.86]W: Yeah, but living in a city, it's convenient to go everywhere.
[08:10.67]There are lots of movie houses, theaters and so on.
[08:15.78]You can take them to the suburbs on the weekends.
[08:19.77]M: Yeah, children are the right age.
[08:23.71]There are lots of things for them here.
[08:26.94]W: You are right.
[08:28.19]They are at the library in Brooklyn.
[08:31.18]And they come back home for lunch,
[08:33.33]then go uptown to the Museum of Natural History.
[08:37.52]There is so much for young people to see and do.
[08:41.72]M: Not just for young people.
[08:44.07]What about me?
[08:46.42]I've never been to the Museum of Natural History.
[08:50.26]W: Neither have I.
[08:51.65]When I was a child,
[08:53.05]I used to go to the Museum of Art.
[08:56.78]M: I've been there several times.
[08:59.73]Twice with children.
[09:01.62]W: Well, I have an idea.
[09:03.57]Next weekend, we go to the Museum of Natural History.
[09:08.62]M: Ok, that's really a very nice idea.
[09:15.35]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:21.25]8. What are the two speakers talking about?
[09:40.69]9. What does the man think of living in the suburbs?
[10:00.71]10. What’s the man’s opinion of the city?
[10:21.13]11. What do we know about the woman 
[10:25.17]according to the conversation?
[10:42.41]Conversation Two
[10:45.43]W: May I come in?
[10:47.93]M: Come in, please.
[10:49.17]Do you know what time it is?
[10:51.26]W: It's 8:20.
[10:53.60]I am very sorry to be late again.
[10:56.79]And I am also sorry to disturb you and others.
[11:00.28]M: All right, what's your excuse this time?
[11:05.22]Don't tell me your alarm didn't go off or your watch stopped.
[11:10.91]I don't wanna hear it!
[11:13.35]W: Excuse me, sir.
[11:14.91]I hit the rush hour.
[11:16.95]You just cannot imagine how terrible the traffic jam is.
[11:21.74]M: Why don't you get up earlier to avoid this time?
[11:25.97]W: I'm sorry, sir.
[11:27.76]I indeed got up early, but my watch is 20 minutes slow.
[11:33.21]M: I'm never late for work, you see.
[11:36.79]I always set my watch 15 minutes fast every day.
[11:42.53]W: Oh, that's a good idea!
[11:45.00]I'll set my watch... 30 minutes fast...
[11:49.81]to avoid hitting rush hour.
[11:52.05]I promise I won't be late in future.
[11:55.39]And I hope you could forgive me once more.
[11:59.18]M: That's right! You are already late for work three times,
[12:04.37]if this happens again, you will be fired.
[12:12.20]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:18.75]12. What was the woman’s excuse before?
[12:37.80]13. What’s the possible relationship between the two speakers?
[12:58.48]14. Why is the woman late?
[13:17.38]15. How many minutes faster will the woman’s watch be 
[13:22.21]than the man’s?
[13:38.53]Section C
[13:40.13]Directions: In this section,
[13:43.47]you will hear three passages.
[13:45.36]At the end of each passage,
[13:47.26]you will hear some questions.
[13:49.10]Both the passage and the questions
[13:50.96]will be spoken only once.
[13:53.21]After you hear a question,
[13:54.85]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[13:57.95]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:02.34]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:05.74]with a single line through the centre.
[14:09.38]Passage One
[14:12.12]In the next few decades,
[14:13.93]people are going to travel very differently
[14:17.02]from the way they do today.
[14:19.82]Everyone is going to drive electrically-powered cars.
[14:24.02]So in a few years,
[14:26.11]people won't worry about running out of gas.
[14:29.42]Some of the large automobile companies
[14:32.88]are really moving ahead with this new technology.
[14:37.37]F&C Motors, a major auto company, for example,
[14:42.09]is holding a press conference next week.
[14:45.61]After the press conference,
[14:47.70]the company will present its new electronically-operated models.
[14:52.98]Transportation in the future won't be limited to the ground,
[14:57.87]many people predict that traffic will quickly move to the sky.
[15:03.78]In the coming years, instead of radio reports
[15:07.93]about road conditions and highway traffic,
[15:10.86]news reports will talk about traffic jams in the sky.
[15:16.11]But the sky isn't the limit.
[15:18.80]In the future,
[15:19.99]you will probably even be able to take a trip to the moon.
[15:24.34]Instead of listening to regular airplane announcements,
[15:28.24]you will hear someone say,
[15:29.97]"The spacecraft to the moon leaves in 10 minutes.
[15:34.41]Please check your equipment.
[15:36.60]And remember no more
[15:38.60]than 10 ounces of carry-on baggage are allowed."
[15:45.38]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:52.24]16. What will be used to power cars in the next few decades?
[16:17.09]17. What will future news reports focus on
[16:22.98]when talking about transportation?
[16:41.06]18. What will passengers be asked to do
[16:46.50]when they travel to the moon?
[17:03.89]Passage Two
[17:06.73]County fairs are a tradition in New England towns.
[17:10.97]They offer great entertainment.
[17:14.21]One popular event is the pie-eating contest.
[17:18.99]If you want to take part in the contest,
[17:22.23]it is a good idea to remember these guidelines:
[17:26.61]first, make sure your stomach is nearly empty of food.
[17:32.02]Eating a whole pie can be hard if you have just finished a meal.
[17:37.35]Next, it is helpful to like the pie you are going to eat.
[17:43.25]The cream types are a good choice.
[17:46.75]They slide down the throat more easily.
[17:50.27]Placing your hands in the right position adds to the chances of winning.
[17:56.47]There is a temptation to reach out and help the eating process.
[18:01.91]This will result in becoming disqualified.
[18:06.49]Don't just sit on your hands.
[18:08.94]If your hands are tied behind your back,
[18:12.17]you will not be tempted to make use of them.
[18:16.00]Now you are ready to show your talent at eating pies.
[18:20.87]The object of course, is to get to the bottom of the pie plate
[18:26.05]before the other people.
[18:28.81]It is usually better to start at the outside and work toward the middle.
[18:34.94]This method gives you a goal to focus on.
[18:38.72]Try not to notice what the other people near you are doing.
[18:43.68]Let the cheers from the crowd spur you on.
[18:47.52]But do not look up.
[18:50.23]All you should think about is eating that pie.
[18:56.77]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:04.39]19. Where is pie-eating contest usually held?
[19:25.10]20. What should a person do before entering a pie-eating contest?
[19:46.99]21. Where is the person advised to put his hands during the contest?
[20:09.41]22. What suggestion is offered for eating up the pie quickly?
[20:31.02]Passage Three
[20:34.01]The period of engagement is the time
[20:36.45]between the marriage proposal and the wedding ceremony.
[20:40.99]Two people agree to marry
[20:43.18]when they decided to spend their lives together.
[20:46.85]The man usually gives the woman a diamond engagement ring.
[20:51.74]That tradition is said to have started
[20:54.83]when an Austrian man gave a diamond ring to the woman
[20:59.16]he wanted to marry.
[21:01.02]The diamond represented beauty.
[21:03.51]He placed it on the third finger of her left hand.
[21:08.11]He chose that finger
[21:10.36]because it was thought that the blood vessel in that finger
[21:13.90]went directly to the heart.
[21:16.53]Today we know that this is not true.
[21:20.14]Yet the tradition continues.
[21:22.76]Americans generally are engaged
[21:25.46]for a period of about one year
[21:27.82]if they are planning a wedding ceremony and a party.
[21:31.85]During this time, friends of the bride may hold a party
[21:35.68]at which women friends and family members give the bride gifts
[21:40.22]that she will need as a wife.
[21:42.47]These could include cooking equipment or new clothing.
[21:47.05]Friends of the man who is getting married
[21:49.89]may have a bachelor party for him.
[21:52.97]This usually takes place the night before the wedding.
[21:58.03]Only men are invited to the bachelor party.
[22:01.52]During the marriage ceremony,
[22:03.95]the bride and her would-be husband
[22:07.10]usually exchange gold rings
[22:09.49]that represent the idea that their union will continue forever.
[22:14.87]The wife often wears both the wedding ring
[22:18.02]and the engagement ring on the same finger.
[22:21.74]The husband wears his ring on the third finger of his left hand.
[22:26.87]Many people say the purpose of the engagement period
[22:30.92]is to permit enough time to plan the wedding.
[22:34.67]But the main purpose is to let enough time pass
[22:38.55]so the two people are sure that they want to marry each other.
[22:42.64]Either person may decide to break the engagement.
[22:46.78]If this happens, the woman usually returns the ring to the man.
[22:52.36]They also return any wedding gifts they have received.
[22:57.65]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[23:05.34]23. What was the diamond ring said to represent?
[23:27.00]24. Why did the Austrian man place the diamond ring
[23:33.09]on the third finger of the left hand of his would-be wife?
[23:53.37]25. What is the chief advantage of having the engagement period?
[24:15.12]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[24:18.08]
