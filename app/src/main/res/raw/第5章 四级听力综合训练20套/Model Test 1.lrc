[00:15.36]College English Test - Band 4
[00:18.40]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:22.68]Section A
[00:25.02]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.41]you will hear three news reports.
[00:30.08]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.88]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:34.51]Both the news report and the questions
[00:36.33]will be spoken only once.
[00:39.17]After you hear a question,
[00:41.01]you must choose the best answer
[00:42.20]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:47.34]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:50.73]with a single line through the centre.
[00:53.71]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:59.43]Hundreds of thousands of people across France have taken
[01:03.27]to the streets to demonstrate against President Nicolas Sarkozy’s plans
[01:08.39]to raise the retirement age.
[01:11.17]Trade unions say
[01:12.62]nearly three million people turned out in scores of demonstrations,
[01:17.59]but the government says less than a million people took part.
[01:21.65]It’s the third day of protests in the past month.
[01:25.63]The pension reform goes
[01:27.22]before the upper house of parliament, the Senate,
[01:30.26]on Tuesday with President Sarkozy insisting that its central provision,
[01:35.36]raising the minimum retirement age by two years to 62,
[01:40.71]is non-negotiable.
[01:42.66]According to the government, the only way
[01:45.84]that the French pension system can remain economically practical,
[01:50.66]given longer life expectancy,
[01:52.87]is that people work for more years.
[01:56.04]However, opponents, including the Socialist Party,
[01:59.62]say the changes are unjust
[02:02.12]and that the pension system can be preserved
[02:04.41]if higher taxes are imposed on financial institutions
[02:08.04]and on the better-off.
[02:10.98]1. What’s the minimum retirement age in France
[02:15.21]before Sarkozy’s plans?
[02:32.17]2. According to the opponents,
[02:35.76]whose interest should be protected?
[02:52.76]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:57.64]Some American schools pay teachers more
[03:00.39]if their students improve on tests.
[03:03.21]Now, there is a growing movement to pay the students,
[03:06.85]in some cases,
[03:08.04]even just for coming to class.
[03:10.58]Schools that pay students can be found
[03:12.87]in more than one-fourth of the fifty states.
[03:15.87]Other schools pay students with food or other rewards.
[03:20.70]Last year,
[03:21.97]the city schools in Coshocton, Ohio, launched a programme.
[03:26.56]They wanted to see
[03:27.80]if paying elementary school students as much as one hundred dollars
[03:32.24]would help in passing state exams.
[03:34.93]Now, Eric Bettinger of Case Western Reserve University
[03:39.35]has reported mixed results.
[03:41.76]Math scores increased,
[03:43.70]but only while students were able to get paid.
[03:46.69]And there was no evidence of higher scores in reading,
[03:49.77]social studies and science.
[03:52.21]Officials will decide later this year whether to continue the programme.
[03:57.46]3. What should American students do to get paid from schools?
[04:18.52]4. What’s the result of the programme to pay students?
[04:38.97]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:44.15]As struggling airlines add extra-luggage fees
[04:47.58]and travelers worry about growing security restrictions,
[04:51.34]services like Luggage Forward and Luggage Free have emerged
[04:55.94]as ways to avoid the troubles of checking bags.
[05:00.12]While typically seen as a luxury,
[05:02.54]more Americans are using such options for run-of-the-mill trips.
[05:07.15]The idea behind the luggage delivery services
[05:10.37]is to make traveling as headache-free as possible.
[05:14.50]Customers load up their suitcases as usual,
[05:17.69]with no special packaging needed.
[05:20.26]Shipping slips for luggage are mailed to them.
[05:23.63]A pickup time is scheduled,
[05:25.72]usually for a two-hour window.
[05:28.14]If the bags are being sent to a hotel,
[05:31.09]the hotel worker will typically call customers
[05:34.03]to let them know their belongings have arrived.
[05:37.51]Rates vary depending on the weight,
[05:37.48]distance and speed of the delivery.
[05:42.92]The new luggage delivery services promise
[05:45.91]to provide greater convenience by helping customers clear customs,
[05:50.70]track packages and pick up luggage at home.
[05:54.33]Still, the price can add up for a big order.
[05:57.81]But compared to the mess it would’ve caused at the airport,
[06:01.14]the price was worth it, said Kolodny,
[06:04.48]a 45-year-old resident of Great Neck, New York.
[06:08.66]5. What is the main idea of the news report?
[06:28.26]6. How long can luggage be preserved in the new delivery services?
[06:49.33]7. What is the major drawback to the new luggage delivery services?
[07:10.35]Section B
[07:12.09]Directions: In this section,
[07:14.59]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:16.91]At the end of each conversation,
[07:18.82]you will hear four questions.
[07:21.41]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:23.28]will be spoken only once.
[07:25.77]After you hear a question,
[07:27.51]you must choose the best answer
[07:29.25]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:34.72]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:38.31]with a single line through the centre.
[07:41.14]Conversation One
[07:44.43]W: Excuse me, Dr. Tyler, your secretary said I should come right in.
[07:49.45]M: Please do, Jenny. How can I help you?
[07:51.89]W: I need to get your signature on my schedule card here,
[07:55.63]on the line above advisor's approval.
[07:58.26]M: Sure, but let's look it over together first.
[08:01.30]How many courses do you have here?
[08:03.09]W: Six.
[08:03.99]M: Six? That's quite a heavy load. Any particular reason?
[08:08.22]W: I had to drop my chemistry course last semester
[08:11.55]when I went into the hospital, so I need to take it again.
[08:15.26]M: So you've already learnt a lot of the material.
[08:18.02]W: Right. And calculus is a part of the second year requirement.
[08:22.90]M: Let's see, Chemistry, Calculus.
[08:25.78]Oh, I see you'll be in my seminar on the modern American novel.
[08:30.03]W: Yes, I'm looking forward to it and the romantic poetry seminar, too.
[08:35.73]M: Two seminars? That is rather a lot.
[08:38.42]Can you handle the work?
[08:39.81]W: I think so. The introductory economics is fairly easy
[08:44.35]and so is the music course.
[08:46.38]M: Well, then I'll be happy to sign the card.
[08:48.86]However, I insist that you come and see me
[08:51.50]after the first week of classes
[08:53.49]so we can make sure this isn't too much for you.
[08:56.28]W: That's a promise.
[08:58.92]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:05.14]8. Which grade is the student in?
[09:24.40]9. Why has Jenny come to see Dr. Tyler?
[09:43.95]10. What does Dr. Tyler seem to be most concerned about?
[10:04.63]11. Which course hasn’t Jenny taken?
[10:24.75]Conversation Two
[10:27.99]W: Hi. How can I help you?
[10:30.18]M: Yes, I'd like to return this sweater for a refund.
[10:33.31]I bought it a week ago.
[10:34.86]W: Well, first of all, what seems to be the problem?
[10:38.69]M: Well, isn't it obvious by just looking at it?
[10:41.77]The first time I washed and dried it,
[10:43.56]the thing shrank at least five sizes.
[10:46.10]It wouldn't even fit a snake.
[10:48.14]W: Uh, I see what you mean,
[10:50.33]but did you follow the washing instructions?
[10:53.10]I think it says here... yeah... right here on the label
[10:57.59]to hand wash it and then to dry it on low heat.
[11:01.22]M: How was I supposed to know that?
[11:02.86]The label is written in Chinese!
[11:04.90]And something else:
[11:06.25]the color faded from a nice dark blue to a seaweed green.
[11:10.08]What kind of merchandise are you trying to sell here anyway?
[11:12.94]W: Listen, sir. We take a lot of pride in our clothing.
[11:16.86]What I can do is allow you to exchange the sweater for another one.
[11:21.65]M: I don't want to exchange it for anything!
[11:23.54]I just want my money back!
[11:25.13]W: Well, I can give you credit on your next purchase,
[11:28.56]and since the item you purchased was on clearance,
[11:31.50]we can't give you a refund.
[11:33.64]M: A clearance item! There wasn't anything on the price tag
[11:36.73]or on the clothing rack that said anything about that.
[11:39.76]W: I guess you didn't read the fine print in our ad.
[11:42.76]Look. Here's the ad, and the information
[11:46.09]about the clearance sale is right here
[11:48.23]at the bottom on the back page.
[11:50.82]M: Where? There? What? That small print.
[11:55.75]You'd need an electronic microscope to see those words.
[12:01.20]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:08.91]12. What’s the purpose of the man returning to that store?
[12:28.68]13. What is one reason why the man wants to return the item?
[12:49.18]14. What is one reason
[12:52.41]why the sales clerk can’t help the customer with his request?
[13:11.08]15. Why couldn’t the man see the information about the clearance sale?
[13:31.60]Section C
[13:33.64]Directions: In this section,
[13:36.58]you will hear three passages.
[13:39.01]At the end of each passage,
[13:40.10]you will hear some questions.
[13:42.64]Both the passage and the questions
[13:44.38]will be spoken only once.
[13:46.82]After you hear a question,
[13:48.46]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[13:51.29]marked A), B), C) and D).
[13:55.87]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[13:59.36]with a single line through the centre.
[14:02.49]Passage One
[14:04.23]The secret of a long and happy marriage appears
[14:07.34]to be not to expect too much from it.
[14:10.53]Far better, US researchers say,
[14:13.07]to aim low to ensure you are not disappointed.
[14:17.00]The key to keeping that newlywed glow
[14:19.83]appears to be forgiveness and communication.
[14:23.52]The study by researchers from Ohio and Florida Universities
[14:27.95]looked at 82 couples.
[14:30.04]They quizzed all the spouses independently over four years.
[14:34.62]Writing in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,
[14:38.60]researchers led by James McNulty,
[14:41.58]professor of psychology at Ohio University, said:
[14:45.26]"In contrast to the idea that expectations
[14:48.41]in the early years of marriage exert main effects
[14:52.04]on satisfaction, the current findings suggest
[14:55.32]that the effects of expectations interact with the skills
[14:59.00]partners bring to their relationships."
[15:02.14]The study also found that people tend to select like-minded partners
[15:06.91]who they believe will be able to maintain a stable relationship.
[15:11.44]The finding contradicts the old belief that opposites attract.
[15:16.17]Instead, the US researchers said
[15:18.71]people looking for long-term relationships
[15:21.49]should select partners who were similar to themselves,
[15:24.93]rather than seeking out the highest quality partner available.
[15:30.25]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:36.87]16. What is the key to a happy marriage according to the study?
[15:57.41]17. How many people are investigated in the study?
[16:16.99]18. Which is the belief of the researchers?
[16:36.51]Passage Two
[16:38.89]Do you have a tough math test coming up?
[16:42.32]Then listen to some classical piano music just before the test.
[16:47.00]You might end up with a higher score.
[16:50.28]Researchers at a university in California conducted an experiment.
[16:55.66]They asked a group of college students to listen to some piano music
[17:00.14]by a famous 18th century composer before taking a math test.
[17:05.71]They were surprised to find that the students' scores jumped 8 to 9 points.
[17:11.78]The music seems to excite nerve activities in the brain
[17:15.47]similar to the activity that occurs
[17:17.61]when a person is figuring out a math problem.
[17:20.79]However, the scientists warn that
[17:23.43]before you get too excited about applying this method to your math test,
[17:27.86]you should remember
[17:29.30]that brain-exciting effects last only 10 to 15 minutes.
[17:34.48]Would rock music work as well as the piano music did?
[17:38.06]No, the scientists say. In fact,
[17:41.05]the less complex music might even interfere
[17:44.13]with the brain's reasoning ability.
[17:48.26]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:54.88]19. What is this passage mainly about?
[18:14.31]20. Why can classical music play a positive role in problem solving?
[18:35.01]21. What is one of the findings of the research?
[18:54.48]Passage Three
[18:57.22]"Where is the University?" is the question
[18:59.96]many visitors to Cambridge ask,
[19:02.34]but no one could point them in any one direction
[19:05.38]because there is no campus.
[19:07.37]The university consists of 31 self-governing colleges.
[19:11.95]It has lecture halls, libraries, laboratories,
[19:15.55]museums and offices throughout the city.
[19:19.43]Individual colleges choose their own students,
[19:22.96]who have to meet the minimum entrance requirements
[19:25.70]set by the university.
[19:27.84]Undergraduates usually live and study in their colleges,
[19:31.52]where they are taught in very small groups.
[19:34.11]Lectures and laboratory and practical work are organized
[19:37.39]by the university and held in university buildings.
[19:41.87]There are over 10,000 undergraduates and 3,500 postgraduates.
[19:47.45]About 40 percent of them are women
[19:49.75]and some 8 percent from overseas.
[19:52.78]As well as teaching, research is of major importance.
[19:56.77]Since the beginning of the 20th century,
[19:59.25]more than 60 university members have won Nobel Prizes.
[20:03.98]The university has a huge number of buildings
[20:06.72]for teaching and research.
[20:09.01]It has more than 60 specialized subject libraries,
[20:13.13]as well as the University Library,
[20:15.77]which, as a copyright library,
[20:18.01]is entitled to a copy of every book published in Britain.
[20:22.83]Examinations are set and degrees are awarded by the university.
[20:27.51]It allowed women to take the university exams in 1881,
[20:31.94]but it was not until 1948 that they were awarded degrees.
[20:38.21]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:45.33]22. Why is it difficult for visitors to locate Cambridge University?
[21:06.82]23. What does the passage tell us about the colleges of Cambridge University?
[21:28.16]24. What can be learned from the passage about the libraries
[21:33.59]in Cambridge University?
[21:50.37]25. What does the passage say about women students in Cambridge University?
[22:11.77]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[22:14.27]
