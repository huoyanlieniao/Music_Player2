[00:15.40]College English Test - Band 4
[00:19.25]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:23.73]Section A
[00:25.67]Directions: In this section,
[00:29.35]you will hear three news reports.
[00:32.45]At the end of each news report,
[00:35.13]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:38.42]Both the news report and the questions
[00:41.46]will be spoken only once.
[00:44.25]After you hear a question,
[00:46.24]you must choose the best answer
[00:48.72]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:54.74]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:59.22]with a single line through the centre.
[01:02.40]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[01:08.87]Rising levels of obesity and unhealthy weights could be linked
[01:14.25]to 670,000 extra cases of cancer in the next 20 years,
[01:20.57]a UK report predicts.
[01:22.56]If current trends continue,
[01:25.16]experts say,
[01:26.35]almost three in four adults could be overweight or obese by 2035,
[01:32.47]bringing a host of health issues.
[01:35.47]Their work suggests
[01:37.46]a rise in the number of people who are overweight or obese
[01:40.99]would contribute to 4.6 million additional cases of type-2 diabetes
[01:47.56]and 1.6 million extra cases of heart disease by 2035.
[01:53.68]The report recommends a number of ways to tackle this problem,
[01:58.51]including introducing a 20 pence per litre tax on sugary drinks
[02:04.03]and a review of how food is advertised online.
[02:08.01]Department of Health officials said
[02:10.90]they had already brought in a ban
[02:13.04]on adverts featuring junk food during children's TV programmes
[02:17.90]and would be launching a childhood obesity strategy shortly.
[02:23.78]1. What is the news report mainly about?
[02:42.51]2. What does the report suggest to tackle the problem?
[03:02.31]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[03:09.62]Staring at a glowing iPhone screen in bed might be bad for your marriage,
[03:14.90]but in the future it will be a little easier on your eyes.
[03:18.29]Apple is adding a new mode called “Night Shift”
[03:21.54]in the next version of its mobile operating system.
[03:24.62]The mode changes the screen from blue light to a warmer setting.
[03:29.10]It detects your location and turns on automatically at night.
[03:33.33]Studies have found that exposure to blue light at night
[03:37.07]can impact our biological clock,
[03:39.36]leading to disturbed sleep.
[03:41.50]Night Shift is one of the new features coming to iPhones
[03:45.04]and iPads later this year.
[03:47.38]Apple released the new version of iOS on Monday.
[03:51.51]New education features in new iOS will let kids
[03:55.39]who are using iPads at school
[03:57.33]log into their personal profile from any shared classroom device.
[04:02.25]A centralized admin account will let teachers control all their student’s IDs
[04:07.09]and manage things like courses and books.
[04:12.05]3. What do we learn about the new mode of iPhone?
[04:31.99]4. What can teachers do with the new education features?
[04:52.29]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[05:00.33]Three Italian consumer groups have accused McDonald’s
[05:04.56]of burdening authorized stores with excessive rents,
[05:08.39]high royalties and restrictive contracts.
[05:11.83]The groups,
[05:13.23]which are backed by the Service Employees International Union,
[05:16.97]have filed the antitrust complaint with the European Commission
[05:20.95]and asked the regulator to open a formal investigation.
[05:25.83]McDonald’s abuse of its dominant market position hurts everyone:
[05:31.43]authorized store owners, consumers, and workers.
[05:35.21]McDonald’s has roughly 6,000 authorized restaurants in Europe
[05:39.99]that pay to use the company’s branding.
[05:43.03]According to the consumer groups' arguments,
[05:45.96]McDonald’s charges the rents that are up to 10 times higher
[05:50.34]than market rates.
[05:51.99]These rents account for 66% of all revenue
[05:55.96]collected from authorized stores in Europe,
[05:58.98]the groups claimed.
[06:00.38]A European Commission spokesperson said
[06:03.71]the group had received the complaint,
[06:05.45]and will now examine it.
[06:07.34]McDonald’s, meanwhile, defended its business model,
[06:11.37]saying it “has helped create the best business opportunities
[06:15.90]for our authorized stores
[06:17.84]and the best overall experience for our customers."
[06:21.90]The allegations are not the only problem McDonald's faces
[06:25.74]on the continent.
[06:27.08]In December,
[06:27.98]the European Commission announced
[06:29.97]it was investigating McDonald’s for failing to pay some taxes
[06:34.66]in both Luxembourg and the U.S.
[06:37.55]McDonald’s shifted profits around
[06:40.50]to avoid paying all the taxes on the royalties
[06:43.11]it collects from authorized restaurants in Europe and Russia.
[06:49.27]5. What do we learn about McDonald’s from the news report?
[07:09.09]6. What did McDonald say to defend its business model?
[07:28.85]7. Why was McDonald’s investigated in Europe?
[07:48.14]Section B
[07:50.43]Directions: In this section,
[07:54.08]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:57.41]At the end of each conversation,
[07:59.95]you will hear four questions.
[08:02.59]Both the conversation and the questions
[08:05.62]will be spoken only once.
[08:08.26]After you hear a question,
[08:10.40]you must choose the best answer
[08:12.74]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[08:18.91]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[08:23.19]with a single line through the centre.
[08:27.04]Conversation One
[08:30.89]M: Good morning, Dr. Smith.
[08:32.68]My name is Peter.
[08:34.22]I am a freshman in your department.
[08:36.36]There are a few things that I am not quite sure of
[08:38.81]and I do need your advice.
[08:41.25]W: Thank you very much for your trust, Peter.
[08:43.29]As your academic advisor I will try my best.
[08:46.18]Just tell me how I can help you, Peter.
[08:48.85]M: I used to major in English,
[08:50.58]but now I have made up my mind to switch to Applied Linguistics,
[08:54.81]concentrating on Teaching English as a Foreign Language.
[08:58.74]It will probably take me two years to get my master's degree
[09:01.93]since I also work part time.
[09:04.07]W: So you want to switch majors?
[09:06.56]M: Yes. But I have been wondering if it is possible.
[09:09.69]W: Well, usually we allow it,
[09:12.08]as long as you have enough credits.
[09:13.57]M: That's good news for me.
[09:15.12]I'm not interested in literature and that sort of thing.
[09:18.75]I want to be a real teacher, Professor.
[09:21.59]Actually, teaching is what appeals to me,
[09:23.73]but I'm worried about the make-up credits.
[09:26.31]I have been taking a lot of courses in English.
[09:29.10]W: You usually do have to make up some credits
[09:32.04]when you switch majors.
[09:33.39]Are you OK on credits?
[09:34.88]M: Not too many.
[09:36.37]I'll have to add about 12 credits
[09:38.67]as far as I can figure from my transcript.
[09:41.26]Would you please let me know how many credits are required
[09:43.99]to get a master's degree?
[09:45.78]W: Usually thirty-six credits are needed.
[09:48.37]If you take five courses per term,
[09:50.38]you'll have enough credits just after two semesters.
[09:53.17]Usually each course is worth three credits.
[09:56.05]To get the six remaining credits
[09:57.95]you either prepare a thesis or take two more courses.
[10:01.41]M: I'm afraid I might find that course load a little too heavy.
[10:05.24]But now I have a clearer idea.
[10:07.43]Thank you very much for your help, Professor.
[10:09.82]W: Well, many students carry a lighter load,
[10:12.01]especially in the first term.
[10:14.00]M: Is there anything else besides the 36 credits for the master's?
[10:18.48]W: You have to have an oral defense.
[10:20.47]M: I see. All this about credits was so complicated
[10:24.10]but now I have more confidence.
[10:25.94]I really appreciate your help, Professor.
[10:27.83]W: Glad I can help. Good luck, Peter.
[10:32.13]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:39.67]8. Why does the man resort to the woman?
[10:58.87]9. What is the woman’s profession?
[11:17.91]10. Why does the man want
[11:21.17]to take up Teaching English as a Foreign Language?
[11:38.94]11. How soon could the man get a master’s degree
[11:44.16]if he takes 4 courses per term?
[12:01.59]Conversation Two
[12:04.87]M: Have you noticed the new dustbin downstairs,
[12:07.80]at the entrance of the main building?
[12:09.60]W: Yeah, of course.
[12:10.65]It looks funny, though, like a battery.
[12:12.63]What's it for?
[12:13.92]Is it really for garbage?
[12:15.62]M: Not really.
[12:16.57]Actually it's a dustbin for used batteries.
[12:19.96]W: Used batteries? What do you mean by that?
[12:22.43]Why do we need a special dustbin for used batteries?
[12:26.28]M: Well, you know there are still a lot of heavy metals
[12:29.41]left in used batteries,
[12:30.89]so by recycling the batteries,
[12:33.52]we can not only make full use of the metals left,
[12:36.30]but also prevent the environment from being polluted.
[12:39.59]W: Oh, I see. Can this work? Our efforts are too insignificant.
[12:45.26]M: Even though we are not ecologists or biologists,
[12:48.65]there is still a lot we can do.
[12:50.59]The Student Union is sponsoring a one-month program
[12:53.78]called "Green Movement",
[12:55.72]which is aimed at making more and more students
[12:58.24]aware of serious environmental problems
[13:00.33]we are facing now.
[13:02.08]W: Sounds quite exciting-"Green Movement".
[13:04.81]What, for example, can I do?
[13:07.15]M: Well, quite a lot.
[13:09.50]For one thing, you can stop using those plastic meal-boxes
[13:13.08]and disposable wooden chopsticks.
[13:15.72]Plastic meal-boxes do great harm to the environment
[13:19.20]and disposable chopsticks are a big waste of forest resources.
[13:23.13]Well, there will be a lecture tomorrow afternoon at four o'clock.
[13:26.92]You may attend if you are interested.
[13:29.11]W: Tomorrow afternoon...
[13:30.90]let me think...
[13:33.09]yeah, I happen to be free.
[13:34.83]I will go there.
[13:36.37]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[13:45.43]12. What is the new dustbin for according to the conversation?
[14:05.18]13. What are the two speakers doing?
[14:24.61]14. What is the purpose of the “Green Movement”?
[14:44.51]15. What will the woman do tomorrow afternoon?
[15:04.35]Section C
[15:05.77]Directions: In this section,
[15:09.73]you will hear three short passages.
[15:12.56]At the end of each passage,
[15:14.60]you will hear some questions.
[15:17.04]Both the passage and the questions
[15:19.52]will be spoken only once.
[15:22.61]After you hear a question,
[15:24.90]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[15:28.93]marked A), B), C) and D).
[15:33.46]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[15:37.84]with a single line through the centre.
[15:41.50]Passage One
[15:44.00]Do you remember a time
[15:45.49]when people were a little nicer and gentler with each other?
[15:49.32]I certainly do.
[15:50.92]And I feel that much of the world has somehow
[15:53.35]gotten away from that.
[15:55.39]Too often I see people rushing into elevators
[15:58.48]without giving those inside a chance to get off first,
[16:01.84]or never saying "thank you"
[16:03.61]when others hold a door open for them.
[16:06.27]We get lazy and in our laziness we think that
[16:10.74]something like a simple "thank you" doesn't really matter.
[16:14.88]But it can matter very much.
[16:17.17]The fact is that no matter how nicely we dress
[16:21.40]or how beautifully we decorate our homes,
[16:23.99]we can't be truly elegant without good manners,
[16:27.71]because elegance and good manners always go hand in hand.
[16:32.34]In fact, I think of good manners as a sort of hidden beauty secret.
[16:37.06]Haven't you noticed that the kindest,
[16:39.90]most generous people seem to keep getting prettier?
[16:43.83]It's funny how that happens, but it does.
[16:46.91]Take the long-lost art of saying "thank you"
[16:50.55]like wearing a little make-up,
[16:52.31]or making sure your hair is neat.
[16:54.75]Getting into the habit of saying "thank you"
[16:57.29]can make you feel better about yourself.
[16:59.98]Good manners add to your image,
[17:02.72]while an angry face makes the best-dressed person look ugly.
[17:07.85]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:14.18]16. What is the passage mainly about?
[17:32.92]17. What does the speaker say about people of the past?
[17:52.61]18. According to the speaker,
[17:55.75]how can we best improve our image?
[18:13.01]Passage Two
[18:15.81]"Go to the playground and have fun",
[18:19.24]parents will often say to their kids.
[18:21.58]But they should remember playgrounds can be dangerous.
[18:25.37]Each year about 200,000 children end up
[18:29.15]in hospital emergency rooms with playground injuries.
[18:32.70]Many injuries involve falls from too high equipment onto too hard surfaces.
[18:38.97]Nearly 70 percent of the injuries happen on public playgrounds.
[18:43.85]Recent studies show they may be badly designed
[18:47.38]-their protective surfaces are inadequate,
[18:50.12]and their equipment is poorly maintained.
[18:52.76]Parents should make sure that the equipment in the playground is safe
[18:56.29]and their children are playing safely.
[18:58.93]Last year, the national program for playground safety
[19:02.86]gave the nation's playgrounds a grade of C for safety
[19:06.04]after visiting more than 3,000 playgrounds nationwide.
[19:10.17]Parents should watch closely.
[19:12.11]They should always be
[19:13.64]within shouting and running distance of their children.
[19:16.64]Young children don't understand cause and effect,
[19:19.72]so they may run in front of moving swings.
[19:22.26]They're also better at climbing up than getting down,
[19:25.25]so they may panic at the top of a ladder.
[19:27.89]It's important for children to know you're watching them.
[19:30.62]Once they feel that sense of security,
[19:33.41]that's when they can be creative.
[19:36.29]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:42.32]19. What is the cause of playground injuries?
[20:01.43]20. What should parents do to prevent playground injuries?
[20:21.79]21. What does the speaker say about young children?
[20:42.12]Passage Three
[20:45.64]For twenty-five years, I was a full-time thief,
[20:48.72]specializing in picking pockets.
[20:51.27]Where I come from in southeast London,
[20:54.15]that's an honorable profession.
[20:56.48]Anyone can break in a house and steal things,
[21:00.22]but picking somebody's pocket takes skill.
[21:03.95]My sister and I were
[21:05.99]among the most successful pickpocket teams in London.
[21:09.83]We worked in hotel and theatre lobbies, airports,
[21:13.63]shopping centers and restaurants.
[21:17.07]Now we don't steal any more,
[21:19.01]but this crime is worldwide.
[21:21.45]Here's how to protect yourself.
[21:24.62]Professional pickpockets do not see victims
[21:28.25]―only handbags, jewels and money.
[21:31.64]Mothers with babies, the elderly,
[21:33.88]and the disabled are all fair game.
[21:36.32]My preferred target was the lone female,
[21:38.96]handbag at her side―the right side to be exact.
[21:42.64]So if I'm next to her,
[21:43.95]I can reach it cautiously with my right hand across my body.
[21:48.23]Only about one woman in a thousand carries her bag on the left,
[21:52.66]and I tended to steer clear of them.
[21:55.66]Women whose bags are hanging in front of them
[21:58.16]are tricky for the pickpocket
[22:00.15]as there isn't a blind side.
[22:02.09]If you want to make it even harder,
[22:04.28]use a bag with handles rather than a strap.
[22:07.62]For men, one of the best places to keep a wallet
[22:10.80]is in the back pocket of tight trousers.
[22:13.64]You'll feel any attempts to move it.
[22:16.63]Another good place is in the buttoned-up inside pocket of a jacket.
[22:21.10]There is just no way in.
[22:23.34]Even better, keep wallets attached to a cord or chain
[22:27.55]that is fastened to a belt.
[22:29.84]A pickpocket needs targets who are relaxed and off-guard.
[22:34.52]The perfect setting is a clothing store.
[22:37.85]When customers wander among the racks
[22:40.58]they are completely absorbed in the items they hold up.
[22:44.12]The presence of a uniformed security guard is even better.
[22:48.20]A false sense of security makes a pickpocket's job much simpler.
[22:54.62]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[23:00.64]22. Why does the speaker say that picking somebody's pocket
[23:06.02]is an honorable profession in southeast London?
[23:24.00]23. According to the speaker,
[23:26.99]who is most likely to become a victim of pickpockets?
[23:45.24]24. In the speaker's opinion,
[23:47.82]what's the best place for a man to keep his wallet?
[24:05.21]25. What is the perfect setting for picking pockets according to the speaker?
[24:26.72]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[24:29.67]
