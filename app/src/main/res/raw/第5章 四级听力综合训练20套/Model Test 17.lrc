[00:15.34]College English Test - Band 4
[00:19.93]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:23.37]Section A
[00:25.57]Directions: In this section,
[00:29.46]you will hear three news reports.
[00:32.31]At the end of each news report,
[00:34.85]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:38.61]Both the news report and the questions
[00:41.34]will be spoken only once.
[00:44.29]After you hear a question,
[00:46.00]you must choose the best answer
[00:48.35]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:54.78]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:58.89]with a single line through the centre.
[01:02.41]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[01:10.35]A huge storm that collapsed part of a cliff on Israel’s central coast 
[01:15.25]led to the discovery of a statue dating back to the Roman period, 
[01:20.12]the Israel Antiquities Authority said Tuesday. 
[01:23.89]The statue of a woman is estimated to be 2,000 years old. 
[01:29.13]It stands 1.2 meters tall, 
[01:32.13]weighs about 200 kilograms and was found with no head or arms, 
[01:37.65]according to a news release by the authority. 
[01:40.71]A person walking on the shore 
[01:43.35]at Ashkelon on the west coast of Jerusalem made the discovery, 
[01:48.10]the authority said. 
[01:49.69]The statue fell into the sea 
[01:51.79]when the cliff collapsed as a result of the storm. 
[01:55.08]The collapse also ruined a bath house 
[01:57.88]that had been in the cliff for many hundreds of years. 
[02:01.57]The storm, 
[02:02.56]one of the strongest Israel has experienced in recent years, 
[02:06.61]brought winds of more than 100 kph 
[02:10.51]that sent 10-meter waves crashing into Israel’s coast.
[02:17.24]1. What do we learn about the statue from the news report?
[02:37.57]2. Where was the statue found?
[02:56.31]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[03:04.06]Four American teenagers, 
[03:05.45]all children of U.S. military personnel, 
[03:07.84]have been arrested on charges of attempted murder 
[03:10.75]after a woman was knocked off her motorbike 
[03:13.14]with rope strung across two poles, 
[03:15.79]Japanese police said.
[03:17.63]The four suspects
[03:18.93]---two 15-year-old boys, a 17-year-old girl 
[03:22.49]and an 18-year-old man---
[03:24.33]were arrested on Saturday, 
[03:25.80]the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department said.
[03:28.88]They are accused of causing a severe head injury 
[03:31.87]to a 23-year-old restaurant employee 
[03:34.43]by stringing a rope between poles across a road.
[03:37.71]U.S. Forces in Japan was informed of the August incident in late October, 
[03:42.65]a public information officer said. 
[03:44.95]There was no clear explanation for the delay 
[03:47.75]in the handover of the suspects to police, 
[03:50.14]other than it involved rules between Washington and Tokyo 
[03:54.29]covering U.S. forces and their dependents in Japan.
[03:57.44]The U.S. military presence and its impact on Japanese residents 
[04:01.37]have been a troublesome issue over the years.
[04:06.73]3. Who was the victim according to the news report?
[04:26.95]4. When were the suspects arrested?
[04:46.41]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:54.56]Leaders in Paris negotiating a climate change agreement 
[04:58.19]missed their deadline Friday. 
[05:01.03]Representatives from 195 countries have spent two weeks in Paris 
[05:07.03]trying to reach agreement at the United Nations climate talks. 
[05:11.36]French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius extended the deadline 
[05:16.26]until Saturday when the deadline could not be met. 
[05:20.45]U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said a lot of progress has been made, 
[05:26.25]but he said, 
[05:27.30]some “very difficult” issues must be resolved. 
[05:31.05]He met with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius Friday 
[05:34.88]after what sources said was a hard night of negotiations.
[05:39.60]The biggest sticking points are financial aid and the long-term goal. 
[05:45.03]The latest draft of the agreement calls 
[05:47.98]for “the widest possible cooperation by all countries” 
[05:52.46]to cut emission of greenhouse gases. 
[05:55.14]Scientists say those gases are warming the planet 
[05:58.29]and changing the climate to an extreme. 
[06:01.62]A major point of disagreement has been 
[06:04.37]who will pay for reducing these emissions. 
[06:07.67]Representatives of 134 developing countries objected to conditions 
[06:13.90]suggested by richer industrialized nations. 
[06:17.55]Richer countries---like the U.S.---
[06:20.26]have produced most of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. 
[06:24.05]Those gases are blamed for rising temperatures on the planet. 
[06:28.25]Poorer nations want developed ones to pay for measures 
[06:32.62]that arrest pollution.
[06:36.10]5. When was the original deadline of the climate talks?
[06:56.10]6. What are the biggest sticking points of the climate talks? 
[07:16.17]7. Why do poorer countries want developed ones 
[07:20.61]to pay for reducing these emissions?
[07:37.87]Section B
[07:39.82]Directions: In this section,
[07:43.16]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:46.44]At the end of each conversation,
[07:49.03]you will hear four questions.
[07:51.62]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:54.81]will be spoken only once.
[07:57.81]After you hear a question,
[07:59.55]you must choose the best answer
[08:02.05]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[08:08.02]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[08:12.56]with a single line through the centre.
[08:16.54]Conversation One
[08:21.85]W: Mark really needs to see this article in Psychology Weekly.
[08:25.68]M: Why? What's it on?
[08:27.97]W: Reasons for negative behavior patterns
[08:30.91]―like procrastination,
[08:32.80]that is, habitual lateness...
[08:35.55]M: You're right. That's Mark.
[08:37.89]He's never on time. So what does it say?
[08:42.47]W: That people who are always late often do it for a reason
[08:46.56]―either conscious or unconscious.
[08:49.98]It could be an expression of anger and resentment
[08:52.57]―or a way of resisting authority.
[08:55.62]It could even be anxiety.
[08:57.86]M: Well, I don't know.
[08:59.94]In Mark's case, I think it's because he wants to be noticed.
[09:04.28]W: That's the next reason in the article
[09:06.73]―the need for attention.
[09:09.13]They give the example of movie stars
[09:11.87]who used to make these grand entrances.
[09:15.25]M: That's not really Mark's style though
[09:17.51]―he's so quiet.
[09:20.02]W: What gets me is that he's late for his friends all the time
[09:24.19]―but not for other things, like work.
[09:27.74]M: Well... but they might deduct pay for that.
[09:31.87]W: Exactly.
[09:33.47]You know, sometimes I'm tempted to tell him to come at,
[09:38.14]say, seven, and everybody else at 7:15.
[09:42.78]Then maybe we wouldn't have to wait so long.
[09:45.83]M: We have to try something.
[09:48.38]You know, he confessed to me one day
[09:51.61]that he was even late for his sister's wedding.
[09:54.61]She was really angry.
[09:56.95]W: I remember that.
[09:58.24]He was not in the wedding
[10:00.18]―so they couldn't start until he got there.
[10:03.75]M: Maybe you should slip
[10:05.14]that magazine under his door―anonymously.
[10:08.34]And hope he gets the message.
[10:14.49]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:21.90]8. What is the main subject of the magazine article?
[10:41.64]9. What might be the reason for Mark’s problem?
[11:01.07]10. What do we learn about Mark’s unusual behavior?
[11:21.04]11. What solution does the woman sometimes consider?
[11:40.88]Conversation Two
[11:43.86]W: Hello, sir. What can I do for you?
[11:46.51]M: Hi, Uh... I have this cassette player here
[11:50.03]that I bought about six months ago.
[11:52.42]And it just ruined four of my favorite cassettes.
[11:56.80][11:56.87]W: Oh dear, I'm sorry.
[11:59.70]M: So I... um... want you to fix it.
[12:03.79]I'm sure it will be no problem, right?
[12:06.99]W: Your sales slip, please?
[12:08.81]M: Yeah, here it is.
[12:10.77]W: I'm sorry, sir. Your warranty's expired.
[12:13.75]M: Well, it ran out ten days ago,
[12:17.07]but I'm sure that you'll... you'll fix the machine for free,
[12:21.55]because the machine was obviously defective
[12:23.97]when I bought it.
[12:25.22]W: I'm sorry, sir. Your warranty has run out.
[12:28.52]There's nothing I can do.
[12:30.07]M: No, no, look.
[12:31.92]I didn't drop it off a building or anything.
[12:34.72]I mean, what difference can ten days make?
[12:37.98]I mean you can...
[12:39.27]W: Sir, I'm sorry, we have the six-month rule for a reason.
[12:43.81]We can't...
[12:44.77]M: Well, surely you won't hold me to ten days on this.
[12:48.45]You can bend the rule a little bit.
[12:50.55]W: Make an exception for you,
[12:52.54]and we'll have to make an exception for everybody.
[12:55.91]You could say it's only a month, it's only two months...
[12:59.75]M: I just lost twenty dollars worth of tapes.
[13:02.34]W: Sir, I'm sorry, it's too late. There's nothing I can do.
[13:06.78]M: It actually ate the tapes. I mean, they're destroyed.
[13:11.47]Paying for this is adding insult to injury.
[13:14.82]It's... it's a good cassette player,
[13:17.77]I mean, I can't pay for this.
[13:20.11]W: Sir, the rules are the rules.
[13:22.21]I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.
[13:27.69]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[13:37.31]12. What’s the man’s purpose of visiting the shop? 
[13:57.32]13. What’s wrong with the purchase?
[14:16.73]14. Why does the woman refuse the man’s request?
[14:37.07]15. What does the woman say about the rule?
[14:57.08]Section C
[14:58.56]Directions: In this section,
[15:02.05]you will hear three short passages.
[15:04.69]At the end of each passage,
[15:06.99]you will hear some questions.
[15:09.24]Both the passage and the questions
[15:11.89]will be spoken only once.
[15:15.13]After you hear a question,
[15:17.38]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[15:21.36]marked A), B), C) and D).
[15:26.10]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[15:30.05]with a single line through the centre.
[15:34.04]Passage One
[15:36.44]Many people suffer from some form of extreme anxiety.
[15:40.12]Some experience occasional attacks of panic for almost no reason.
[15:44.92]Others go around in a state of continual uneasiness.
[15:49.07]How do we control anxiety?
[15:51.52]The best way is to take drugs
[15:54.00]that help patients manage their anxiety.
[15:57.09]Patients who take these drugs say that
[16:00.28]they are able to work, to sleep
[16:02.48]and to go to places they feared to visit before.
[16:06.18]But the effects of the drugs on the human body,
[16:09.97]especially on the nervous system
[16:11.71]have not been known for a long time.
[16:14.61]Scientists have started a series of studies
[16:17.85]to identify the effects of the drugs on the brain
[16:20.60]and have gained some insight into the costs and benefits
[16:24.73]of the anti-anxiety drugs.
[16:28.37]They are valuable because they can reduce the effects of
[16:31.41]expected failure, frustration and disappointment.
[16:35.41]But their value demands a price.
[16:38.40]Two effects of the drugs are obviously harmful.
[16:42.75]First, they weaken a person's ability to react to changes;
[16:47.08]second, they fail to help a person deal with unexpected troubles.
[16:52.58]It is fairly sure that people will meet with problems
[16:55.78]they have never expected,
[16:57.62]so these harmful effects
[16:58.87]may make the price of anti-anxiety drugs too high.
[17:05.14]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:10.57]16. According to the speaker, what is the best way to manage anxiety?
[17:32.68]17. What does the speaker say about the anti-anxiety drugs?
[17:52.95]18. What harmful effect do the anti-anxiety drugs have?
[18:15.04]Passage Two
[18:18.01]Deep Springs is an American college.
[18:20.27]It is an unusual college.
[18:23.31]It is high in the White Mountains in California,
[18:26.56]not in a college town.
[18:28.69]The campus is a collection of old buildings,
[18:31.79]with no beautiful classrooms.
[18:34.29]The only college-like thing about Deep Springs is its library.
[18:39.67]Students can study from the 18,000 books 24 hours a day.
[18:45.11]The library is never crowded
[18:47.57]as there are only 24 well-qualified male students at the college.
[18:52.89]In addition, there are only five full-time professors.
[18:57.29]These teachers believe in the idea of this college.
[19:01.92]They need to believe in it!
[19:04.33]They do not get much money.
[19:06.00]In fact, their salaries are only $9,000 a year
[19:10.28]plus room and meals.
[19:12.86]The school gives the young teachers
[19:14.86]as well as the students
[19:16.66]something more important than money.
[19:20.19]"There is no place like Deep Springs,"
[19:22.88]says a second-year student from New York State.
[19:26.42]"Most colleges today are much the same,
[19:29.12]but Deep Springs is not afraid to be different."
[19:32.70]He says that students at his college are in a situation
[19:36.50]quite unlike in the other school.
[19:38.93]Students are there to learn,
[19:40.70]and they cannot run away from problems.
[19:43.84]There is no place to escape to!
[19:46.69]At most colleges, students can close their books and go to a film.
[19:51.98]They can go out to restaurants or parties.
[19:54.78]Deep Springs' students have completely different alternatives.
[19:59.62]They can talk to each other or to their teachers.
[20:03.02]Another possible activity is to go to the library to study.
[20:07.90]They might decide to do some work.
[20:10.89]The student who doesn't want to do any of these activities
[20:14.68]can go for a walk in the desert.
[20:17.68]Deep Springs is far from the world of restaurants and cinemas!
[20:22.63]There is not even a television set on campus.
[20:27.03]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:33.09]19. What do we learn about Deep Springs College from the passage?
[20:53.88]20. What is the total number of students at Deep Springs College?
[21:14.40]21. What does the speaker say about the teachers in the college?
[21:34.15]22. What can students do in their spare time?
[21:53.86]Passage Three
[21:56.39]Are some people born clever, and others born stupid?
[21:59.80]Or is the development of intelligence
[22:02.44]dependent on environment and experience?
[22:05.73]Strangely enough, the answer to both questions is yes.
[22:09.66]To some extent, our intelligence is given us at birth.
[22:14.27]On the other hand, a child who lives in a boring environment
[22:19.25]will develop his intelligence less than one
[22:22.13]who lives in rich and varied surroundings.
[22:25.27]It is easy to show that intelligence is something we are born with.
[22:29.41]The closer the blood relationship between two people,
[22:32.55]the closer they are likely to be in intelligence.
[22:36.19]Therefore if we take two unrelated people
[22:38.73]at random from the population,
[22:41.06]it is likely that their degree of intelligence
[22:43.81]will be completely different.
[22:45.95]If we take two identical twins,
[22:48.09]they will very likely be as intelligent as each other.
[22:52.47]Relations like brothers and sisters, parents and children,
[22:55.98]usually have similar intelligence,
[22:58.46]and this clearly suggests that intelligence depends on birth.
[23:03.40]Imagine that we take two identical twins
[23:06.20]and put them in different environments.
[23:08.60]We might send one, for example,
[23:10.69]to a university and the other to a factory
[23:13.82]where the work is boring.
[23:15.86]We would soon find differences in intelligence development,
[23:20.08]and this indicates that environment as well as birth plays a part.
[23:24.67]This conclusion is also suggested by the fact
[23:27.42]that people who live in close contact with each other,
[23:30.27]but who are not related at all,
[23:32.61]are likely to have a similar degree of intelligence.
[23:37.55]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[23:43.65]23. What degree of intelligence might a child have,
[23:48.99]if he lives in a rich and varied environment?
[24:06.51]24. Why does the speaker say that intelligence depends on birth?
[24:27.48]25. What do we learn about unrelated people who live in close contact
[24:34.41]according to the passage?
[24:51.35]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[24:54.47]
