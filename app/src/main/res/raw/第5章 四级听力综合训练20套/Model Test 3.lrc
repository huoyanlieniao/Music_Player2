[00:15.45]College English Test - Band 4
[00:19.43]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:24.16]Section A
[00:26.05]Directions: In this section,
[00:29.73]you will hear three news reports.
[00:32.72]At the end of each news report,
[00:35.25]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:38.64]Both the news report and the questions
[00:41.67]will be spoken only once.
[00:44.46]After you hear a question,
[00:46.35]you must choose the best answer
[00:48.75]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:55.02]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:59.20]with a single line through the centre.
[01:02.54]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[01:09.18]If you contact the customer service department of a government agency
[01:13.96]or a major U.S. company,
[01:16.00]or order something over the phone,
[01:18.69]it’s likely that your call will be answered
[01:21.13]by someone with a disability,
[01:23.47]working from their home.
[01:25.16]It could be on a farm in Iowa,
[01:27.79]or a small town in the Vermont Mountains.
[01:30.33]It’s one example
[01:31.88]how computer technologies is giving disabled people easier access
[01:36.65]to job market.
[01:38.30]Ed McCann is one of more than 300 disabled order entry clerks
[01:43.57]in 42 states who are working for the Internal Revenue Service,
[01:48.45]the IRS.
[01:49.89]“The calls that come in for forms and publication orders to the IRS
[01:54.82]come to me,
[01:56.06]and I take information for processing those forms.
[01:59.89]People who call me sometimes are not really clear
[02:03.48]on what exactly they would need
[02:05.77]and I’d give them the assistance and guidance
[02:08.70]determining what they would need.”
[02:12.47]1. What is the news report mainly about?
[02:31.17]2. How many disabled clerks working for the IRS?
[02:51.16]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:59.05]The Italian aid group Emergency has had a tense relationship
[03:03.28]with local authorities in violence-racked Helmand province,
[03:06.81]due in part to its policy of treating all patients.
[03:10.49]Afghan officials said
[03:12.58]they arrested three Italian Emergency workers Saturday,
[03:15.92]a doctor, a nurse and a logistics worker.
[03:19.10]Afghan officials said
[03:20.74]they were held as part of an investigation into an unproved plot
[03:25.27]to kill the governor of Helmand province.
[03:27.61]Helmand Province Governor Gulab Mangal said
[03:31.39]an Emergency staff member received 500,000 dollars
[03:35.08]as an advance payment for killing him.
[03:37.91]In total nine people,
[03:40.00]including six Afghans,
[03:41.60]were held after hand bombs and other weapons were discovered
[03:45.48]in the storeroom of the Emergency-run hospital
[03:47.92]in Helmand’s capital, Lashkar Gah.
[03:50.95]Emergency founder Gino Strada
[03:53.49]scolded the charge of the aid group’s three workers.
[03:58.77]3. What happened on Saturday?
[04:17.27]4. What do we learn about the Italian aid group Emergency?
[04:37.90]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:45.81]If a new idea in America becomes a law,
[04:49.55]people who suffer from obesity could suffer financially too.
[04:53.83]The US state of Arizona wants to charge overweight citizens 50 dollars annually
[05:00.60]if they fail to follow their doctors’ advice.
[05:04.28]People with children or who are overweight
[05:07.31]because they suffer from a medical condition would be excluded.
[05:11.34]If the idea is approved by Congress,
[05:14.33]smokers and diabetics who fail to stick to a healthy lifestyle
[05:18.96]will also have to pay.
[05:21.55]Medicaid,
[05:22.59]the organisation which provides healthcare to the poor in the USA,
[05:27.17]costs the government 339 billion dollars a year.
[05:31.90]Monica Coury,
[05:33.45]assistant director at Arizona’s Medicaid programme,
[05:36.84]said that this proposal would ask people to give something back.
[05:41.72]She said that Arizona would take a carrot
[05:44.90]and stick approach to the problem.
[05:47.14]As well as punishing people who go against their doctor’s wishes,
[05:51.27]awards would be offered for following advice,
[05:54.31]possibly a keep-fit video.
[05:56.69]Arizona’s senator Kyrsten Sinema has not backed the plans,
[06:01.72]saying that there isn’t a system to decide
[06:04.61]whether someone is or isn’t following medical advice.
[06:09.42]Other critics claim
[06:10.96]that people don’t need the government to look after them;
[06:14.16]if they want to be fat and smoke,
[06:16.29]the “nanny state” shouldn’t try to stop them.
[06:21.71]5. What is the new idea of Arizona?
[06:40.92]6. What is Medicaid?
[06:58.68]7. Why do Kyrsten Sinema go against the plans?
[07:18.87]Section B
[07:20.71]Directions: In this section,
[07:24.45]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:27.84]At the end of each conversation,
[07:30.58]you will hear four questions.
[07:32.92]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:36.15]will be spoken only once.
[07:38.84]After you hear a question,
[07:40.93]you must choose the best answer
[07:43.37]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:49.49]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:53.70]with a single line through the centre.
[07:57.95]Conversation One
[08:00.69]M: So, Susan,
[08:02.58]do you have anything planned for this Saturday?
[08:05.93]W: Uh, I'm kind of busy.
[08:08.12]Why do you ask?
[08:09.82]M: Oh, I was wondering
[08:11.95]if you'd like to get together and do something,
[08:15.44]like watch a movie or take a walk down by the lake.
[08:19.27]W: I'd love to,
[08:20.87]but I'm really going to be busy all day on Saturday.
[08:24.84]M: What do you have to do on that day?
[08:27.62]W: First, my mom asked me
[08:29.52]to help clean the house in the morning,
[08:31.91]and then I have a dentist appointment at 12:30.
[08:35.63]I can't miss that 'cause I've canceled twice before.
[08:40.85]M: Well, what about after that?
[08:43.90]W: Well, I'm going to be running around all day.
[08:47.18]After the dentist appointment,
[08:49.48]I need to meet Julie at 2:00 to help her
[08:52.91]with her science project
[08:54.09]that's due on Monday morning at school.
[08:57.19]M: Okay, but are you free after that?
[09:00.57]W: Hardly. Then I have to pick up my brother
[09:03.87]from soccer practice at 4:30,
[09:06.11]and my mom asked me to cook dinner for the family at 5:30.
[09:11.18]I feel like a slave sometimes.
[09:14.17]Then, I have to clean the dishes
[09:17.02]and finish reading my history assignment.
[09:19.50]Who knows how long that'll take?
[09:22.54]M: Wow, sounds like you're going to have a full day.
[09:26.17]Hey, listen, why don't I come over later in the evening,
[09:31.05]and we can make some popcorn and watch a movie.
[09:34.29]W: Oh, that'd be great,
[09:36.77]but our video machine is broken.
[09:39.29]M: Huh. Well,
[09:41.63]let's just play a game or something.
[09:44.02]W: Sounds good,
[09:45.82]but give me a call before you come.
[09:48.41]My mom might try to come up with something else for me to do.
[09:54.32]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:01.91]8. What does Susan have to do on Saturday morning?
[10:21.99]9. What time is Susan meeting with Julie?
[10:41.47]10. How does Susan feel about her schedule on Saturday?
[11:01.71]11. Why can’t they watch a video at Susan’s house?
[11:22.17]Conversation Two
[11:25.06]W: So, how are things going, Steve?
[11:28.69]M: Well, to be honest, Carla,
[11:31.28]I was feeling great on Saturday,
[11:33.77]but I started to feel sick Sunday afternoon.
[11:37.55]I thought I'd get better,
[11:39.69]but I feel worse than before.
[11:42.18]And I'm really worried
[11:43.95]because I'm scheduled to have a presentation at work on Friday,
[11:48.03]so I have to be better by then.
[11:50.72]W: Well, what seems to be the problem?
[11:53.90]M: Well, I thought I had the flu,
[11:56.79]but the doctor said it was just a bad cold.
[12:00.37]He gave me some cold medicine
[12:02.57]to take care of my stuffy nose and fever.
[12:06.15]I'm supposed to take the medicine three times a day after eating,
[12:10.33]but it doesn't seem to help.
[12:12.97]He also told me to stay off my feet for a day or so,
[12:17.21]but I'm so busy these days.
[12:19.69]W: Listen, forget about that medicine!
[12:22.74]I have just the thing to get rid of bad colds.
[12:26.58]You see, my mom is really into herbal medicine.
[12:31.45]M: Oh, no, thanks.
[12:33.79]W: Ah, come on! Give it a try.
[12:36.78]You just take some of my mom's herbal tea
[12:40.11]and drink it four times a day.
[12:42.40]Believe me.
[12:43.75]You'll be up and dancing around in no time.
[12:47.08]M: Dancing around in no time, right?
[12:49.82]Well, I guess.
[12:52.25]Nothing else seems to be doing the job.
[12:55.19]W: Great. I'll come by your place at 7:30.
[12:59.82]See you then.
[13:02.56]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[13:10.82]12. How long has the man been sick?
[13:30.11]13. What is the man worried about?
[13:48.95]14. What’s the matter with the man?
[14:07.46]15. What does the woman suggest the man do?
[14:26.90]Section C
[14:29.54]Directions: In this section,
[14:32.73]you will hear three short passages.
[14:35.32]At the end of each passage,
[14:37.76]you will hear some questions.
[14:39.95]Both the passage and the questions
[14:42.64]will be spoken only once.
[14:45.49]After you hear a question,
[14:48.02]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[14:51.61]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:56.04]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[15:00.52]with a single line through the centre.
[15:04.08]Passage One
[15:06.40]How much living space does a person need?
[15:10.98]What happens when his space requirements are not adequately met?
[15:16.41]Sociologists and psychologists are conducting experiments on rats
[15:22.03]to try to determine the effects of overcrowded conditions on man.
[15:27.68]Recent studies have shown
[15:29.87]that the behavior of rats is greatly affected by space.
[15:34.65]If rats have adequate living space,
[15:38.03]they eat well, sleep well, and reproduce well.
[15:42.31]However, if their living conditions become too crowded,
[15:47.19]their behavior pattern and even their health perceptibly change.
[15:52.51]They cannot sleep and eat well,
[15:55.35]and signs of fear and tension become obvious.
[15:59.33]The more crowded they are,
[16:01.77]the more they tend to bite each other and even kill each other.
[16:06.99]Thus for rats,
[16:08.43]population and violence are directly related.
[16:12.02]Is this a natural law for human society as well?
[16:17.09]Is adequate space not only desirable,
[16:20.68]but essential for human survival?
[16:23.81]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:29.47]16. What affects rats' behavior?
[16:48.25]17. What effect may inadequate living space have on rats
[16:55.02]according to the passage?
[17:11.01]18. What is the experiment done on rats intended to prove?
[17:31.92]Passage Two
[17:34.06]Crime is a serious problem in Britain.
[17:37.79]One sort of crime which particularly worries people
[17:42.27]is juvenile delinquency
[17:44.51]―that is, crimes committed by young people.
[17:47.75]For some years,
[17:49.54]juvenile delinquency has been increasing.
[17:53.42]There are two main sorts of juvenile crime,
[17:56.80]stealing and violence.
[17:58.94]Most people do not understand
[18:01.18]why young people commit these crimes.
[18:04.46]There are, I think,
[18:06.40]a large number of different reasons.
[18:09.59]These crimes are not usually committed by people
[18:12.88]who are poor or in need.
[18:15.07]Young people often dislike and resent the adult world.
[18:20.00]They will do things to show that they are rebels.
[18:24.28]Also in Britain today it is easier for young people
[18:28.93]to commit crimes because they have more freedom
[18:32.32]to go where they like and more money to do what they like.
[18:36.80]There are two other possible causes
[18:39.71]which are worth mentioning.
[18:41.65]More and more people in Britain live in large towns.
[18:45.78]In a large town no one knows
[18:48.92]who anyone else is or where they live.
[18:52.60]But in the village I come from crimes are rare
[18:56.93]because everybody knows everyone else.
[19:00.31]Although it is difficult to explain,
[19:03.42]I think the last cause is very important.
[19:07.36]Perhaps there is something wrong with our society
[19:11.19]which encourages violence and crime.
[19:13.97]It is a fact that all the time children are exposed to films
[19:18.25]and reports about crime and violence.
[19:21.55]Many people do not agree that this influences young people,
[19:26.77]but I think that young people are very much influenced
[19:30.60]by the society they grow up in.
[19:33.44]I feel that the fault may be as much
[19:36.38]with our whole society as with these young people.
[19:41.06]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:46.76]19. What is "juvenile delinquency"?
[20:05.37]20. What can we learn about the young people
[20:08.66]who commit crimes according to the passage?
[20:26.37]21. Who are to blame for juvenile delinquency
[20:31.00]according to the speaker?
[20:47.17]Passage Three
[20:49.71]Millions of words have been written
[20:51.92]about young people in the United States.
[20:55.26]There are reasons for this great interest in the ideas,
[20:59.54]feelings, and actions of youth.
[21:02.52]Today there are about seven million Americans
[21:06.30]in colleges and universities.
[21:09.14]Young persons under twenty-five make up
[21:12.32]nearly half of the American population.
[21:15.66]Many of these will soon be in charge of the nation.
[21:19.89]Naturally their ideas are important to everyone in the country,
[21:25.46]and it is necessary for older people
[21:28.69]to understand what they think and feel.
[21:33.12]College students today have strong opinions
[21:36.44]about right and wrong.
[21:38.53]They are deeply interested in making a better life for all people,
[21:44.26]especially for those who have not been given a fair chance before now.
[21:49.78]They see much that is wrong in the lives of their parents.
[21:54.06]It is hard for them to see what is right and good in the older way.
[22:00.24]As a result, there is often trouble in American families.
[22:05.51]Your country may be meeting such problems, too.
[22:10.76]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:16.84]22. How many Americans are there in colleges and universities?
[22:37.97]23. Why do older people need to understand the ideas of young people
[22:44.34]according to the passage?
[23:01.00]24. What are college students deeply interested in?
[23:20.90]25. What is the opinion of American
[23:25.31]young people about the lives of their parents?
[23:43.22]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[23:47.06]
