[00:15.34]College English Test - Band 4
[00:18.76]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:22.15]Section A
[00:24.32]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.61]you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.71]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.61]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:34.05]Both the news report and the questions
[00:36.45]will be spoken only once.
[00:38.59]After you hear a question,
[00:40.59]you must choose the best answer
[00:42.35]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:46.98]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:50.54]with a single line through the centre.
[00:53.79]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:59.57]The establishment of 23 new Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) mean 
[01:04.55]that 8,000 square miles of UK waters now have environmental protection. 
[01:10.29]The announcement has been welcomed 
[01:11.99]by conservation and wildlife organizations.
[01:14.74]However they, along with fishermen’s groups, 
[01:17.74]are concerned that there is no management plan. 
[01:20.93]They say it will be difficult to balance competing interests 
[01:24.53]in the reserves. 
[01:25.88]At first, 127 sites were proposed as MCZs. 
[01:31.25]The government has so far tried to set up 50, 
[01:33.94]covering an area the size of Wales.
[01:36.23]The establishment of 23 new (MCZs) means 
[01:39.59]that 20% of English waters are now considered protected. 
[01:43.79]The sites range from the Cromer Shoal Chalk Beds in the North Sea, 
[01:47.76]down to Land’s End in the South West.
[01:50.34]The aim is to conserve habitats like coral colonies, 
[01:54.23]geological features such as chalk reefs, 
[01:57.44]and species such as the stalked jellyfish and spiny lobsters.
[02:03.60]1. What is the news report mainly about?
[02:23.82]2. What is the purpose of the establishment of new MCZs?
[02:45.38]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:50.81]Gen Badrodin Haiti, the national police chief, 
[02:55.05]said Sunakim and one other attacker had both been convicted criminals. 
[03:00.91]Jakarta's chief of police, 
[03:02.81]Insp Gen Tito Karnavian, 
[03:05.81]said a hunt was under way 
[03:07.56]for terror cells believed to be behind the attack.
[03:11.76]Three men were arrested near Jakarta early on Friday, 
[03:16.32]police told local media. 
[03:18.17]A police spokesman, 
[03:19.77]Anton Charliyan, 
[03:21.22]confirmed on Friday that those 
[03:23.52]who organised the attacks were associated with IS.
[03:28.10]Two of the criminals, he added, 
[03:30.37]were “known to have committed similar radical activities 
[03:34.59]some time ago”. 
[03:35.95]Earlier, Bahrum Naim, 
[03:38.50]an Indonesian believed to be fighting with IS in Syria, 
[03:42.49]was named as the suspected co-ordinator.
[03:46.28]Insp Gen Karnavian said Naim’s “vision” was 
[03:50.96]to unite various IS-supporting groups across South East Asia. 
[03:56.14]IS released a statement saying it had targeted citizens of countries 
[04:01.06]which are part of the international alliance fighting the group, 
[04:05.54]which controls parts of Syria and Iraq.
[04:11.12]3. When were the three attackers arrested?
[04:30.11]4. What was the Bahrum Naim’s vision?
[04:49.37]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:54.50]Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam has contacted his lawyer, 
[04:58.61]according to an unconfirmed report.
[05:00.60]Abdeslam has been on the run 
[05:02.81]since he was driven back to Belgium 
[05:05.37]hours after the gun and bomb attacks 
[05:07.59]which left 130 people dead on 13 November. 
[05:11.62]According to a reliable source, 
[05:13.81]the Belga news agency said he had got in touch with lawyer Sven Mary. 
[05:19.10]Mr Mary has refused to comment on the report 
[05:22.09]and the federal police have described it as “only a rumour”.
[05:25.65]Meanwhile, 
[05:26.60]the Paris prosecutor’s office has named Chakib Akrouh 
[05:30.29]as the suicide bomber 
[05:31.78]who blew himself up in a Saint-Denis flat linked to the attackers. 
[05:36.32]Akrouh was a Belgian-Moroccan national, 
[05:39.12]born in Belgium in 1990.
[05:41.51]Mr Mary denied a similar report last month 
[05:44.90]by Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad. 
[05:47.54]He has said he would be prepared to represent the criminal, 
[05:50.88]who is thought to have dropped off three suicide bombers 
[05:53.82]before the attack at the Stade de France.
[05:56.76]CCTV pictures showing Abdeslam at a petrol station 
[06:00.61]close to the Belgian border in northern France, 
[06:03.30]hours after he reportedly took part in the Paris attacks.
[06:09.45]5. Why has Abdeslam been on the run?
[06:29.60]6. What did the federal police regard as “only a rumour”?
[06:50.91]7. What do we learn from the CCTV pictures?
[07:11.37]Section B
[07:13.03]Directions: In this section,
[07:15.48]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:17.83]At the end of each conversation,
[07:19.56]you will hear four questions.
[07:21.95]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:24.35]will be spoken only once.
[07:26.49]After you hear a question,
[07:28.05]you must choose the best answer
[07:29.78]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:35.43]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:38.83]with a single line through the centre.
[07:42.29]Conversation One
[07:45.38]W: Hi, Kaven. Your roommate told me
[07:47.57]that I could find you in the TV lounge.
[07:49.82]What are you doing here?
[07:51.31]M: What does it look like I am doing?
[07:53.50]W: Well, it looks like you are watching television,
[07:56.29]but we have a linear algebra mid-term tomorrow,
[07:59.79]so I thought you'd be studying for it
[08:02.49]and maybe I can study with you.
[08:04.45]M: Oh, well, I was just taking a break.
[08:07.89]This linear algebra stuff gives me a headache
[08:11.63]if I work on it too long.
[08:13.73]W: I know what you mean.
[08:15.38]I've been working on it for three hours already.
[08:18.63]I'm beginning to go cross.
[08:21.22]I'd been thinking at the sample problems.
[08:24.92]I just don't get some of them.
[08:26.83]M: But I can't believe you are coming to me.
[08:29.66]I mean you do know what I got on the last test, don't you?
[08:34.20]W: Yeah, I know. You told me.
[08:36.46]I just thought two heads might be better than one.
[08:39.88]M: Yeah, that's a nice idea.
[08:42.02]But... you know, I wish I knew that person in our class
[08:46.81]who got a hundred on the last test.
[08:49.10]She didn't miss a question. Umm... was it Elizabeth?
[08:54.85]W: Oh yeah, Elizabeth! She is a friend of mine.
[08:59.31]She'd be a big help right now.
[09:01.17]Why don't I give her a call?
[09:03.01]M: What! At this hour? It's already ten thirty.
[09:07.39]I don't wanna impose on her.
[09:09.55]W: Yeah, I guess you are right. But you know what?
[09:13.48]She owes me a big favor.
[09:15.37]Let's at least give her a call and see what she says.
[09:18.71]Maybe going over some of the problems with us
[09:21.58]would help her review the material.
[09:24.27]M: It's worth a try.
[09:27.87]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:34.05]8. What’s the woman’s purpose of looking for the man?
[09:53.44]9. Why is the man surprised 
[09:56.41]that the woman wants to study linear algebra with him?
[10:15.28]10. What do we know about Elizabeth according to the conversation?
[10:35.80]11. Why doesn’t the man want to call Elizabeth?
[10:55.63]Conversation Two
[10:58.96]W: Hi, Tim.
[10:59.95]Are you doing some last-minute shopping before the weekend?
[11:02.90]M: Actually, I'm looking for supplies
[11:05.68]to put together 72-hour kits for my family.
[11:09.30]W: What's that?
[11:11.09]M: Basically, a 72-hour kit contains emergency supplies
[11:15.39]you would need to sustain yourself for three days
[11:18.35]in case of an emergency.
[11:20.49]W: So, what do you keep in it?
[11:22.95]M: Well, you should have enough food
[11:25.73]and water to last you three days,
[11:28.20]and you might want to pack a basic water filter
[11:31.54]in case your only water source turns out
[11:34.25]to be a pool of bug-infested water.
[11:36.93]W: Ugh!
[11:38.27]M: As for food, you should keep it simple:
[11:40.97]food that requires little or even no preparation and that doesn't spoil.
[11:46.83]W: That makes sense.
[11:48.03]M: Then, you have to decide on the type of shelter you might need.
[11:52.14]You might have to evacuate to a shelter,
[11:55.03]possibly with hundreds or thousands of other people.
[11:58.82]W: That doesn't sound very fun..
[12:01.32]everyone packed together like sardines in a can.
[12:05.06]M: I always pack a sleeping bag or small, lightweight tent
[12:09.59]in the event that I have to survive on the street or in a park.
[12:13.65]W: Wow. What about money? I have a credit card.
[12:17.70]M: That will help. But you'd better be prepared with coins and cash,
[12:21.83]and having small bills is a must.
[12:25.13]W: So, what do you do to communicate with other family members
[12:29.43]in case you get separated?
[12:31.38]M: I always pack two-way radios to communicate with the group.
[12:35.44]You can never depend on cell phones.
[12:38.87]Plus, you should decide on a meeting point
[12:42.02]in case your family gets separated.
[12:44.87]W: Well, that sounds like a detailed plan.
[12:50.36]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:56.36]12. What does the man want to buy?
[13:15.78]13. What does the man say about food?
[13:35.73]14. What does the woman think of an emergency shelter?
[13:56.17]15. What should be relied on in communication with the group 
[14:01.71]according to the man?
[14:18.80]Section C
[14:20.89]Directions: In this section,
[14:23.69]you will hear three short passages.
[14:25.64]At the end of each passage,
[14:27.28]you will hear some questions.
[14:29.27]Both the passage and the questions
[14:31.27]will be spoken only once.
[14:34.12]After you hear a question,
[14:35.32]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[14:38.21]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:42.51]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:46.15]with a single line through the centre.
[14:49.57]Passage One
[14:51.98]Are you looking for a good relationship with someone special?
[14:54.87]What type of person is the best person for you?
[14:58.84]Is it the person with the highest IQ?
[15:01.68]Is it the most beautiful or most handsome person?
[15:04.93]How about the richest person or the most ambitious?
[15:09.92]Is your ideal partner the most traditional
[15:12.52]or the most modern person?
[15:14.96]Is he or she the person like you, or most unlike you?
[15:18.83]The answer, psychologists say, is none of the above.
[15:23.29]Why? Because they are all extremes.
[15:26.63]In a number of research studies,
[15:29.19]psychologists asked couples these questions.
[15:32.66]The answers were clear.
[15:34.22]Most people are happy with moderation
[15:36.82]―with partners who are not the most or the best,
[15:40.20]or the least or the worst.
[15:42.61]People are more comfortable with partners
[15:44.74]who are not so special.
[15:47.00]The research showed several other important things.
[15:50.90]In a love relationship, two things can cause trouble.
[15:55.19]First, trouble happens when both people get angry quickly.
[15:59.62]This is not surprising.
[16:01.88]Second, trouble happens when people
[16:04.11]don't expect to change themselves in a relationship.
[16:07.78]Do you stay calm when you disagree with someone?
[16:10.92]Are you ready to change yourself?
[16:13.43]If you can tolerate disagreement and are willing to change,
[16:16.85]maybe you are ready for a serious relationship.
[16:23.07]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:29.47]16. What's the passage mainly about?
[16:49.21]17. What's the result of the research studies?
[17:09.06]18. According to the speaker,
[17:11.76]what are essential for a serious love relationship?
[17:31.82]Passage Two
[17:33.82]Approximately 90% of people in the world
[17:36.63]are naturally right-handed.
[17:39.03]Why is this so, and are we born one way or the other?
[17:44.40]The answer to this question is rather complicated.
[17:48.12]In babies and young children, no single side becomes dominant
[17:53.06]until around the age of eight.
[17:55.45]At 12 weeks, babies usually use both hands equally,
[17:59.89]but by 16 weeks, they mostly use the left hand for touching.
[18:05.48]By 24 weeks, they have changed again and start using both hands.
[18:11.09]Then at 28 weeks, they become one-handed again,
[18:15.37]although this time it is the right hand that is used more.
[18:19.87]At 32 weeks, they start using both hands again.
[18:23.91]When they reach the age of 36 weeks, there is another change,
[18:28.47]with most babies now preferring to use the left hand.
[18:33.26]Between 40 and 44 weeks,
[18:35.24]the right hand is once again more used.
[18:38.89]At 48 weeks, babies switch to using their left hands again,
[18:43.82]and then between 52 and 56 weeks, the right hand takes over.
[18:49.83]There are further changes still.
[18:52.49]At 80 weeks, the right hand loses control,
[18:55.62]and both are used again equally.
[18:58.32]When the young child reaches the age of two,
[19:00.81]the right hand takes over again,
[19:03.06]but between two and a half and three years,
[19:06.15]both hands are used equally.
[19:09.01]Things finally become stable at around four years
[19:12.28]and stay the same until,
[19:13.98]by the age of eight, one hand is strongly dominant over the other.
[19:19.00]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:24.78]19. Which hand do babies use most for touching
[19:28.79]when they are at 16 weeks?
[19:46.58]20. Until how old will a child's one hand be strongly dominant over the other?
[20:08.74]21. What do we learn about babies' using their hands?
[20:29.15]Passage Three
[20:30.94]Mr. Stevenson was the owner of a general appliance store.
[20:34.18]He had seen many newly-weds coming into his store to shop
[20:38.07]for their first refrigerator, washer and dryer, and air-conditioner.
[20:42.22]Pen and pencil in hand,
[20:44.32]they would ask him a lot of questions about price,
[20:46.76]features and after-sale services,
[20:49.66]but they would usually walk away at the end of their inquiry.
[20:54.01]The other day a young couple came into his store.
[20:57.76]They asked him all the usual questions
[20:59.72]and he answered all of them patiently.
[21:02.21]But when he suggested an order at the end,
[21:05.05]they replied firmly,
[21:06.85]"We'll have to look around places first."
[21:09.85]Although feeling a bit disappointed,
[21:11.81]Mr. Stevenson did not show it.
[21:14.43]Instead, he smiled, moved closer and said,
[21:17.17]"I know you will go to Discount Dan
[21:19.23]to look at the price tags.
[21:21.17]That's perfectly understandable.
[21:23.10]I do the same. In fact, they sell the same stuff as we do.
[21:27.26]But if you buy things there, there is something you will not get.
[21:31.26]And that is me. I come with everything I sell.
[21:35.05]I've been in the business for thirty years
[21:37.16]and in a few years' time I'm going to give my store
[21:40.31]to my daughter and son-in-law.
[21:42.05]I hope they will carry on the family business.
[21:44.59]I stand behind everything I sell and I will make sure
[21:48.00]that you will never regret buying things from me."
[21:50.81]After this short speech Mr. Stevenson
[21:53.70]offered the young couple some ice-cream
[21:55.80]to thank them for their interest.
[21:57.49]Impressed by his honesty and sincerity,
[22:00.51]the young couple decided to place an order.
[22:04.95]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:11.02]22. How does Mr. Stevenson make a living?
[22:29.97]23. Why do many couples walk away after their inquiry?
[22:51.07]24. What did Mr. Stevenson assure the young couple?
[23:11.66]25. What made the young couple decide to place an order?
[23:31.93]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[23:35.93]
