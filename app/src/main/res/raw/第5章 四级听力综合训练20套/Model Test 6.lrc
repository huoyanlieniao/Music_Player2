[00:15.41]College English Test - Band 4
[00:18.59]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:22.34]Section A
[00:24.39]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.58]you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.77]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.71]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:34.15]Both the news report and the questions
[00:36.44]will be spoken only once.
[00:38.68]After you hear a question,
[00:40.58]you must choose the best answer
[00:42.60]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:46.88]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:50.51]with a single line through the centre.
[00:53.35]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:59.00]UN extends African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia.
[01:04.02]South African Ambassador Dumisani Kumalo says he voted for the resolution,
[01:09.20]but adds he was not enthusiastic about it.
[01:12.43]Kumalo said he had expected the Security Council
[01:15.34]to make a firm decision about sending U.N. peacekeeping troops
[01:18.93]to Somalia to supplement the African Union mission.
[01:22.76]“The African Union, it’s like,
[01:24.50]when your house is on fire,
[01:26.59]the neighbors come with the buckets of water,
[01:28.73]but the neighbors are not the fire engine,” he said.
[01:32.02]“The fire engine is the United Nations.
[01:34.81]So we want to see the United Nations getting involved
[01:38.02]on the ground in Somalia
[01:39.96]because that issue belongs to the United Nations.
[01:43.44]It cannot be left only to the African Union.”
[01:47.14]The African Union has sent 8,000 troops to a peacekeeping mission.
[01:51.62]But, six months in,
[01:53.31]fewer than one-quarter of them have arrived.
[01:56.45]There are currently 1,700 African Union troops,
[02:00.58]all from Uganda.
[02:03.23]1. What did Kumalo expect the Security Council to do?
[02:23.44]2. What do we learn about the African Union?
[02:42.61]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:48.33]The Commerce Department said sales fell
[02:51.37]by 11.3% to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 355,000 homes,
[02:59.63]down from a revised 400,000 in October.
[03:03.71]The fall reflects the extension of first-time buyer tax credits,
[03:08.34]which had become due in November.
[03:10.67]The total was far lower than analysts had expected,
[03:14.56]and the data wiped out early gains in shares on Wall Street.
[03:18.69]Home sales had been boosted
[03:20.78]by buyers looking to take advantage of the tax credit,
[03:24.56]but now that they have been extended to April,
[03:27.31]the incentive to buy has disappeared,
[03:30.13]analysts say.
[03:31.14]As a result,
[03:32.61]“buyer traffic is likely to be flat until spring,”
[03:36.54]predicted Mark Vitner at Wells Fargo Securities.
[03:40.12]The median sales price for November was 217,000 dollars.
[03:47.84]3. What’s the main reason for the dropping in new home sales?
[04:07.95]4. What do we learn from Mark Vitner’s remark?
[04:26.82]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:32.09]Reports in Israeli media say
[04:34.72]Israel’s ambassador to the United States Michael Oren told Israeli diplomats
[04:39.90]that American-Israeli relations were facing a crisis of historic proportions.
[04:45.33]Washington is angry at last week’s announcement
[04:48.41]by Israel during a visit by the US Vice President
[04:51.59]that more new Jewish homes were to be built
[04:53.96]in occupied East Jerusalem.
[04:56.00]But on Monday,
[04:57.13]the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Israeli parliament
[05:01.21]the building project would continue.
[05:03.45]Mr. Netanyahu has been presented with a choice,
[05:07.23]an violation with the right-wing members of his ally,
[05:10.97]or with the Americans.
[05:13.73]With his speech to the Knesset,
[05:15.42]he seems to have chosen to put the needs of domestic politics first.
[05:19.65]It seems the Americans are so angry
[05:22.49]because they believe Mr. Netanyahu went back on an understanding.
[05:26.62]This was apparently
[05:28.26]that Israel would not push forward
[05:30.25]any big new settlement building projects in East Jerusalem.
[05:34.13]This was necessary if the Palestinians were to be persuaded
[05:38.14]to join the long delayed negotiations
[05:40.63]so difficultly put together by US go-betweens.
[05:45.88]5. What did Michael Oren say about the American-Israeli relations?
[06:06.94]6. What caused the crisis between America and Israel?
[06:27.33]7. What does Netanyahu pay most attention to?
[06:47.99]Section B
[06:49.63]Directions: In this section,
[06:52.22]you will hear two long conversations.
[06:54.86]At the end of each conversation,
[06:56.75]you will hear four questions.
[06:58.59]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:01.13]will be spoken only once.
[07:03.12]After you hear a question,
[07:04.91]you must choose the best answer
[07:06.90]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:12.08]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:15.96]with a single line through the centre.
[07:18.72]Conversation One
[07:22.19]W: Hey, Dave!
[07:23.53]I haven't seen you for ages.
[07:25.87]How have you been?
[07:27.32]M: Oh, I'm doing okay,
[07:29.36]but school has been really busy these days,
[07:32.59]and I haven't had time to relax.
[07:35.08]W: By the way, what's your major anyway?
[07:38.41]M: Hotel Management.
[07:40.15]W: Well, what do you want to do once you graduate?
[07:43.43]M: Uh... I haven't decided for sure,
[07:46.12]but I think I'd like to work for a hotel
[07:49.15]or travel agency in this area.
[07:51.24]How about you?
[07:52.59]W: Well, when I first started college,
[07:55.32]I wanted to major in French,
[07:57.76]but I realized I might have a hard time
[08:00.65]finding a job using the language,
[08:02.99]so I changed my major to Computer Science.
[08:06.97]With the right skills,
[08:08.77]landing a job in the computer industry
[08:11.35]shouldn't be as difficult.
[08:13.39]M: So, do you have a part-time job
[08:15.93]to support yourself through school?
[08:17.92]W: Well, fortunately,
[08:19.42]I received a four-year academic scholarship
[08:22.60]that pays for all of my tuition and books.
[08:25.74]M: Wow. That's great!
[08:27.43]W: Yeah. How about you?
[08:29.47]Are you working your way through school?
[08:31.86]M: Yeah. I work three times a week
[08:34.74]at a restaurant near campus.
[08:36.63]W: Oh. What do you do there?
[08:38.77]M: I'm a cook.
[08:39.77]W: How do you like your job?
[08:41.81]M: It's okay.
[08:42.91]The other workers are friendly,
[08:45.29]and the pay isn't bad.
[08:47.74]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[08:53.87]8. What does the man want to do after he graduates?
[09:14.19]9. What is the woman majoring in?
[09:33.00]10. How does the woman pay for college?
[09:51.97]11. Where does the man work part-time?
[10:11.99]Conversation Two
[10:15.38]W: Hello, Ultimate Computers.
[10:17.77]May I help you?
[10:19.06]M: Yes, this is Jack Kordell from Hunter's Office Supplies.
[10:23.54]May I speak to Elaine Strong, please?
[10:26.53]W: I'm sorry,
[10:27.33]but she's not in right now.
[10:29.32]M: Okay, do you know when she'll be back?
[10:32.61]W: Uh, yes,
[10:33.70]she should be here later on this afternoon
[10:36.89]maybe about 4:30.
[10:39.03]May I take a message?
[10:40.87]M: Yes. Ms. Strong sent me a brochure
[10:43.71]detailing your newest line of laptop computers
[10:46.79]with a description of other software products,
[10:49.53]but there wasn't any information about after-sales service.
[10:53.96]W: Oh, I'm sorry.
[10:55.45]Would you like me to fax that to you?
[10:57.94]M: Yes, but our fax is being repaired at the moment,
[11:02.17]and it won't be working until around 2:30.
[11:05.01]Hum... could you try sending that information around 3:30?
[11:09.98]That should give me time to look over the material
[11:12.77]before I call Ms. Strong, say, around 5:00.
[11:17.54]W: Sure. Could I have your name,
[11:20.45]telephone number, and fax number, please?
[11:23.24]M: Yes. Jack Kordell and the phone number is 560-1287.
[11:31.06]And the fax number is 560-1288.
[11:37.23]W: Okay. Jack Kordell.
[11:39.52]Is your name spelled C-o-r-d-e-l?
[11:43.55]M: No. It's Kordell with a "K" and two "l".
[11:47.68]K-o-r-d-e-l-l.
[11:51.66]W: All right, Mr. Kordell.
[11:53.45]And your phone number is 560-1287,
[11:58.59]and the fax number is 560-1288.
[12:04.18]Is that correct?
[12:05.37]M: Yes, it is.
[12:06.57]W: All right.
[12:07.56]I'll be sure to send you the fax this afternoon.
[12:11.00]M: Okay, bye.
[12:13.88]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:20.46]12. Why can’t Elaine Strong answer the phone?
[12:40.37]13. What does the man want the woman to send?
[12:59.23]14. What do we know about the man’s fax machine?
[13:19.18]15. What can we learn about the man?
[13:38.74]Section C
[13:40.19]Directions: In this section,
[13:43.52]you will hear three short passages.
[13:45.66]At the end of each passage,
[13:47.40]you will hear some questions.
[13:49.15]Both the passage and the questions
[13:51.24]will be spoken only once.
[13:53.38]After you hear a question,
[13:55.27]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[13:58.45]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:02.58]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:06.17]with a single line through the centre.
[14:09.15]Passage One
[14:11.93]The water clock was an ancient clock.
[14:14.92]It could be used on cloudy days,
[14:17.36]at night, and indoors.
[14:19.75]Such clocks were probably first used in Egypt about 2,000 B.C.
[14:26.00]They were also used for many years in Arabia,
[14:29.53]India, China, and all of Europe.
[14:33.16]The simplest water clock needed just two parts
[14:36.99]―a small bowl and a large bowl.
[14:40.08]The small bowl had a tiny hole in the bottom;
[14:43.56]the large bowl was divided into equal parts,
[14:47.19]and marked by lines.
[14:49.17]Water was poured into the small bowl,
[14:52.21]and it fell slowly down into the large bowl in tiny drops.
[14:56.94]Usually it took an hour for the water
[15:00.07]to rise from one line to the next in the large bowl.
[15:03.90]A beautiful water clock was made in Persia
[15:07.04]over a thousand years ago.
[15:09.49]It was presented as a gift to the Emperor of France.
[15:13.81]This water clock could be heard as well as seen.
[15:18.57]The dial of the clock was made up of twelve doors,
[15:22.21]each representing an hour.
[15:24.39]Every hour a door opened,
[15:27.23]and the proper number of metal balls
[15:29.42]dropped onto a thin brass plate to strike the hour.
[15:33.90]At twelve o'clock,
[15:35.59]twelve tiny horsemen came out and shut all the doors.
[15:40.41]This was probably one of the first striking clocks.
[15:45.20]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:50.61]16. When was the first water clock probably made?
[16:10.25]17. What do we know about the structure
[16:14.59]of the simplest water clock?
[16:30.39]18. What did the striking water clock use to strike hours?
[16:51.23]Passage Two
[16:54.74]When my husband was promoted,
[16:57.18]we put our house up for sale.
[16:59.57]Three weeks later,
[17:01.11]it was still on the market.
[17:03.25]I became a busy housekeeper.
[17:06.44]Every room had to be kept tidy,
[17:09.08]and dishes had to be washed and put away when used.
[17:13.61]Then one day the doorbell rang unexpectedly at 8 a.m.
[17:18.59]Sleepily, I opened the door
[17:21.40]and saw our agent standing there
[17:23.40]with a couple from New York.
[17:25.79]"There had been no time to call," he explained,
[17:29.22]"because the couple had to catch a plane home."
[17:33.10]The three people made their way past the dirty breakfast dishes
[17:37.04]on the kitchen table and into a bedroom with unmade beds.
[17:41.71]As I retreated into a bathroom to comb my hair,
[17:45.99]I heard the man say something to his wife.
[17:49.42]Then they both laughed.
[17:51.85]Two days later,
[17:53.70]the agent phoned to tell me that the couple had bought the house.
[17:58.02]He repeated what the buyer had said
[18:00.54]when he handed over the check the following day:
[18:04.41]"That house has a warm, lived-in feeling,
[18:08.31]just like ours."
[18:10.94]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:17.66]19. Why did the speaker sell her house?
[18:37.12]20. Why did the agent call on the speaker so early in the morning?
[18:58.14]21. Why did the couple laugh in the speaker's house?
[19:18.44]Passage Three
[19:20.63]When you take a walk in any of the cities in the West,
[19:24.46]you often see a lot of people walking dogs.
[19:28.10]It is still true that a dog is the most useful
[19:31.48]and faithful animal in the world,
[19:34.12]but the reasons why people keep a dog have changed.
[19:38.39]In the old days people used to train dogs
[19:41.18]to protect themselves against attacks by other beasts.
[19:45.35]And later they came to realize that a dog
[19:48.12]was not only useful for protection
[19:50.88]but willing to obey his master.
[19:53.87]For example, when people used dogs for hunting,
[19:57.55]the dogs would not eat what was caught without permission.
[20:02.31]But now people in the city need not protect themselves
[20:05.99]against attacks of animals.
[20:09.13]Why do they keep dogs, then?
[20:11.47]Some people keep dogs to protect themselves from robbery.
[20:15.94]But the most important reason is for companionship.
[20:20.32]For a child, a dog is his best friend
[20:23.26]when he has no friends to play with.
[20:25.95]For young couples, a dog is their child
[20:28.87]when they have no children.
[20:31.30]For old couples, a dog is also their child
[20:35.24]when their real children have grown up.
[20:38.04]So the main reason why people keep dogs
[20:41.02]has changed from protection to friendship.
[20:45.39]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:50.90]22. According to the passage,
[20:54.63]what were dogs trained for in the past?
[21:12.16]23. Why were dogs used for hunting?
[21:31.07]24. What is the most important reason for people
[21:36.04]in the city to keep dogs now?
[21:53.17]25. What is the main idea of this passage?
[22:13.14]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.
[22:16.23]
